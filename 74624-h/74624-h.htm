<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span>
book is uniform with my similar book on the Russian Navy, and
is designed to have an exactly similar scope; that is to say, it
traces the Japanese Navy from the earliest period up to the time of
the outbreak of the war with Russia in February, 1904. It then deals
with the dockyards of Japan, the armament and equipment of her Fleet,
with her <i>personnel</i>, both officers and men, and finally with all
those side issues and semi-political questions which have brought the
modern Japanese Fleet into existence and governed the Japanese building
programme. In an Appendix, certain matters that may seem to demand
detailed attention are dealt with separately.</p>

<p>In preparing this book for the press—a task that I began so long ago
as the year 1900—I have received the most kind and willing assistance
of a great many personal friends in the Fleet of “Britain’s ally.” To
them I would express my most cordial thanks. Especially would I mention
my indebtedness in various—I might say innumerable—ways to Admirals
Yamamoto Gombey, Dewa, Kamimura, Ito, and Ijuin; Captains Yamada,
Uchida, Kawashima, and Kashiwabara; Commanders Kuroi, Takarabé, Hirose,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
Takeshita, Yamanaka; Lieut.-Commanders Nomaguchi, Hideshima, Sato,
Horiuchi; Staff-Paymaster Minuma; Lieutenants Ishikawa, Yamamoto,
Yamagi, Fukura, Matsui, Sasaki; Engineer-Lieutenant Kimura;
Chief-Constructor Matsuo; Constructor Kondo; and a great many
others—all personal friends, to whose suggestions it is due that I
came to write this book at all.</p>

<p>I am neither pro-Japanese nor pro-Russian. As I write, disaster is
thick upon the Russian Fleet, and to many close friends in it go those
sympathies which, had things been the other way about, would have gone
as surely to the Japanese Fleet. To write this book without bias has
been my special aim; and in view of the enthusiastic admiration which
the Japanese Fleet is now evoking in the Anglo-Saxon world, I have
especially tried not to be blind to such defects as the Japanese Navy
may exhibit. This, however, is obvious in the body of the book, and
needs no mention here, any more than reference is required in this
Preface to the courage and skill which Japanese sailors have shown.</p>

<p>Portions of some of the chapters have, in some form or other, appeared
in the <i>Engineer</i>, <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, <i>Daily Mail</i>,
<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, <i>Collier’s Weekly</i>, or <i>Forum</i>. To
the editors of these papers I desire to make the usual acknowledgments,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I<br> EARLY HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
earliest Japanese history, like that of all other nations, is a
mass of myths and legends. But out of this one solid fact has been
evolved: the Japanese were a race who invaded the island kingdom by way
of Korea, much as the Saxons and other Teutonic tribes invaded Britain.
They therefore used the sea at a very early period of their history.</p>

<p>They found aboriginal tribes when they came, and of these the Ainu
still exist in the north, a race as distinct as our Celts in the north
of Scotland. The immigrant race are always spoken of and accepted as
Mongolians, though in Japanese legend the invaders had, as in similar
Western myths, a divine origin. Incidentally, it is interesting to note
that a Japanese, with kindred tastes to those Western <i>savants</i>
who have found the cradle of the human race in Lapland or in Central
Africa, has built a theory by which ancient Egypt was the early home of
the Japanese. To support this theory numerous small similarities were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
brought forward; but it does not seem to have made headway in Japan, or
to be known in the Western world. It is, as regards plausibility, about
on a par with the Anglo-Israelite theory that had once quite a vogue in
this country, and is by no means without disciples to-day.</p>

<p>Whence they came, however, is a matter of no moment here. Japanese
national history begins with the expedition led by the Emperor Jimmu,
at a date which a loose chronology fixes at 660 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
This is the earliest over-sea operation unconnected with deities and myths.</p>

<p>Jimmu, who, according to the legends, was the grandson of the Sea
Deity’s daughter, led an expedition eastward from Mount Takachiho,
and eventually found himself on the shores of the Inland Sea, and
here built a fleet, by means of which he reached Naniwa (Osaka), and
consolidated the empire.</p>

<p>For the next seven or eight centuries the nation was forming; but
beyond a legend, suggestive of the story of Jonah, nothing is heard of
ships or boats till 202 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when the Empress Jingo
equipped a great fleet for the invasion of Korea. As an early instance of the
use of “sea-power,” this expedition has laid great hold on Japanese
imagination; but since the transportation of the flagship by legions
of fishes, with which the Empress has made an alliance, is the central
point of the story, its nautical details can hardly be seriously
considered. What is of more moment is the undoubted fact that the
expedition took place, that it was a complete success for Japan, and
laid the foundations of that Japanese interest in Korea which is to-day
so potent a factor in the Far Eastern problem.

<p>Korea paid tribute without question for some three hundred years. About
the year 520, however, the Emperor Keitai Tenno collected a fleet, and
conducted some operations against the Koreans that served to tighten
Japan’s hold on her over-sea possessions. From this time onward for the
next two or three hundred years Japan grew as a trading nation, and
intercourse with both Korea and China became common. As in those days
every merchant ship became a warship when required, Japan must have
ranked as a considerable naval power.</p>

<p>As for the ships, these may have been either mere boats or small
coasting junks, probably differing very little from the boats and junks
of the present day.</p>

<p>About the year 650 Japanese garrisons were driven out of Korea by
hostile tribes, assisted by the Chinese, and with the expelled Japanese
came many Koreans, an immigration that continued for some considerable
period.</p>

<p>In the middle of the ninth century the Samaurii, or military caste,
whose descendants to-day provide the bulk of naval officers, first
began to arise. The Shoguns, afterwards to become such a power, were
originally generals, there being one in command of each of the four
military districts into which the Emperor Sujin had divided Japan. A
Shogun with any special powers did not arise till the year 1200 or so,
when Yoshinaka made himself <i>Sei-i-Shogun</i> (Chief Shogun).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>As he was driven to suicide soon afterwards in the civil war then
desolating the empire, the post did not convey any great advantage to
him; but Yaritomo whose troops had defeated him, became after a time
<i>Sei-i-tai-Shogun</i> (great barbarian compelling Shogun). This civil
war—between the Taira and the Minamoto clans—culminated in a naval
battle. The former are credited with 500 junks, which, in addition to
the soldiers, were crowded with women and children and the fugitive
emperor. At Dan-no-ura, on the Inland Sea, these were overtaken by
the Minamoto with 700 vessels, and the smaller fleet was annihilated.
This decisive action ended the civil war, but it created the system of
Shogun rule, whereby all the governing of the country was in the hands
of Yoritomo, the Emperor being a mere figure-head and puppet in his
hands.</p>

<p>The descendants of Yaritomo, as Shoguns <i>de jure</i>, did not
exercise much power <i>de facto</i>, for regents (the Hojo) acted for
them. In time, too, tutors came to act for the regents, and under this
condition of government, plunged into a species of anarchy, Japan faced
the great Chinese invasion of 1281.</p>

<p class="spa2">Having resolved on the capture of Japan, the Chinese sent envoys
demanding its surrender. These, after being sent from pillar to post in
a search for the real governing power, were eventually killed by the
populace. The Chinese then prepared a fleet of 300 of their own and
Korean ships, added the Japanese sun to the consuming dragon on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
Chinese flag, and invaded to consummate the capture. On the water they
encountered no opposition, but on landing they were met and defeated by
the Japanese, united in the presence of a common danger. A great storm
at the same time destroyed the hostile fleet, and the invasion was at
an end.</p>

<p>It was followed by more internal strife, till in 1333 the Hojo were
finally put down. Shortly afterwards the chief power came into the
hands of the Shoguns.</p>

<p>Despite the civil warfare, Japan still made headway as a maritime
State. Trade and piracy were conducted not only with Korea and China,
but Japanese vessels sailed regularly to the distant shores of Siam.</p>

<p class="spa2">In 1542 the Portuguese first came into touch with Japan. Three
cannon were presented to the Shogun, and a little later Pinto arrived on the
scene, and taught the manufacture of gunpowder. Jesuits followed, and
made such headway that in the next civil war the Christian Japanese, to
the number of 600,000 or more, were a strong political factor.</p>

<p>In 1587 Hideyoshi the <i>Taikio</i>, the <i>de facto</i> ruler of
Japan, issued an edict against the Christians, many missionaries were
expelled, and the ports open to foreign vessels were finally limited
to one only, Nagasaki, as at that time the suspicion first began that
soldiers would presently follow the missionaries.</p>

<p>About the same period Hideyoshi, who had designs upon China and Korea,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
began to prepare warships. He also endeavoured to create a fleet of
European-built ships, but the traders whom he approached on the matter
refused to sell their vessels. He had, therefore, to content himself
with a junk navy, which was raised much as fleets were raised in
England at the same period, by levies upon the coast districts. The
princes of these districts were required to furnish sailors to man the
ships that they provided.</p>

<p>The invasion of Korea was carried out by two divisions, the first of
which, under Konishi, reached Fusan on April 13, 1592. The town, which
had for some two hundred years been used as a Japanese trading port,
was easily captured, and the army then marched to the capital. The
fleet lay inactive at Fusan for some time, but Konishi, in the midst of
a victorious career on land, presently conceived the idea of using his
fleet also. It was, therefore, sent round to the westward, where it met
a Korean fleet.</p>

<p>The Koreans, whose ships were constructionally superior, made out to
sea, and the Japanese following, sustained a defeat that caused them to
retire to Fusan again.</p>

<p>After this Chinese troops appeared in large numbers, and, though the
invaders won a few battles, they were checked, and compelled to fall back.</p>

<p>Peace negotiations were opened in 1596, but these fell through, and in
1597 130,000 fresh Japanese troops were sent to Korea.</p>

<p>In the latter part of this same year the Korean fleet attempted to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
signally defeated by the Japanese vessels. Most of the attacking fleet
were destroyed. No headway was, however, made by the Japanese land
force, and in 1598 the expedition withdrew.</p>

<p>In the year 1600 William Adams, an Englishman, reached Japan, and,
though for a time imprisoned at the instigation of the Jesuits, he
eventually gained liberty and consideration from Ieyasu, the Shogun.
He built for the Shogun, first a small 18-tonner, and then, in 1609,
a ship of 120 tons. In this ship some Spaniards who had been wrecked
on the east coast of Japan were sent to Acapulco. They appear to have
navigated themselves, and the vessel was kept, but a much larger ship
was sent to the Shogun as a present in return for his kindness.</p>

<p>In 1611, owing to Adams’s partiality for the Dutch, these secured from
the Shogun permission to trade with any port in the country. A little
later the British East India Company secured the same advantages, but,
owing to the outbreak of war between England and Holland, a good deal
of isolated fighting took place between the traders, till it ended in
the withdrawal or destruction of the English.</p>

<p>In 1614 the Japanese ruler began to be thoroughly alarmed at the
progress of Christianity, and the expected advent of Portuguese
soldiers to take possession of the land. All foreign Christians were
ordered to leave the country, all native ones to renounce their creed.
In 1616 the majority of Christians who still held to their faith were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
disposed of by the same means that in Europe were used to ensure
conversion to Christianity.</p>

<p>In 1637 a revolution broke out amongst some of the Samaurai, or soldier
class, who had been compelled to become farmers. Such Christians as had
survived the massacres joined these.</p>

<p>After some defeats, the rebels were shut up in a large deserted castle
at Hara, where 160,000 men besieged them. A tremendous defence was
made, and the besiegers, failing to make much headway, applied for
and secured aid from the Dutch factory at Hivado. Guns were lent, and
finally a Dutch warship, the de Ryp, 20 guns, bombarded the castle from
the bay, without, however, effecting its reduction. Eventually the
castle was taken, and practically the whole garrison executed.</p>

<p>In 1640 the rivalry between the Dutch and Portuguese, of which the
Dutch assistance against the rebellious Jesuit converts was probably an
incident, came to a head. It ended in the expulsion of the Portuguese,
and the establishment of the Dutch at Nagasaki as the sole Western
nation having dealings with Japan.</p>

<p>Here for two hundred years the Dutch traded unmolested. The civil
commotion quieted down, and with her seclusion from the outside world
Japan entered upon an era of domestic peace. There were no more great
civil wars, and, save for the conflicts of the Samaurai against each
other, the nation grew ignorant of the art of war.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>As these Samaurai were the ancestors of modern Japanese naval officers,
some account of their methods of training may be worthy of study, for
to them it is undoubtedly due that Japan exists as one of the great
Powers to-day. Otherwise she would assuredly have sunk to the Chinese
level of an ultra-high civilisation in which courage has no place,
and in which the military profession is lower than the meanest civil
calling. From all this the Samaurai saved Japan.</p>

<p>The country was then under a feudal system. The Emperor, the nominal
head of the State, was a mere figure-head, too sacred to concern
himself with mundane affairs—a condition of mind which generations
of clever tutelage at the hands of various Shoguns had produced. More
often than not the Shogun’s rule was of a similar nature, a regent
being the real head of the State. Under the Shogun or his regent were
the governors of provinces; under these the great feudal lords, each of
whom maintained his Samaurai, or fighting men. The soldier-ant is the
nearest natural equivalent to these Samaurai, who only very partially
resembled our knights of the Middle Ages. Below the Samaurai, and
cordially despised by them, were the lower classes, engaged in trade
and agriculture. The exact social equivalent of the Samaurai in our
society system does not exist, but probably the old “squireens,” a now
almost extinct class of small country gentry, would most nearly occupy
the same social status. The Samaurai might be richer or poorer than the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
working class, but in all cases they cordially despised them, and were
in turn respected or feared.</p>

<p>These Samaurai lived in a constant state of killing and being killed.
If one of them left his house, he took his life in his hand from that
moment. Duels were frequent, murders common, and the fearful form of
suicide known as hari-kari was performed by them without a shudder at
the slightest hint of an insult that could not be avenged. Vendettas,
too, were everlasting, so that altogether the Samaurai were by heredity
inured to a callous disregard of life and suffering. In all their
crimes and vices they cultivated the grand Spartan virtues, and Japan
will yet, perhaps, reap the benefit of those centuries of training.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br> THE OPENING OF JAPAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
knowledge of the Dutch hold upon Japan inspired other nations with
a desire to secure similar benefits. Russia, in particular, strove to
secure a footing, but all her attempts were unavailing. British and
Americans met with a like fate; there was no Government that would deal
with them, the law of isolation had gone forth, and isolated Japan
remained. So greatly, too, did the nation esteem its state, that a law
long existed whereby the building of a ship of any size was a crime
punishable by death.</p>

<p>At last, in 1848, the United States, which had deep interests in the
whale fisheries in Far Eastern waters, and was also concerned in
establishing a line of steamers between California and the recently
opened free ports in China, took official instead of merely individual
measures to open up communication with Japan. A coaling station in
Japan was an absolute necessity if the projected line of steamers was
to be realised; but the reaching of any governing body with power to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
grant such a station was the difficulty. However, in 1852, Commodore
Perry was sent with a squadron to Japan, and reached the Bay of Yeddo
in July, 1853, bearing a friendly letter from the President of the
United States to the Emperor of Japan.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The commodore had orders to use force, if necessary, as a last
resort;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but the thousands of troops that were gathered to meet him made
no attack. Having managed to deliver his message and impress the
authorities with the fact that an answer would be required, the
commodore left.</p>

<p>So soon as he had gone the Shogun’s Government found itself on the
horns of a dilemma. If a treaty were made with the foreigners, internal
trouble from a people already permeated with a desire to restore to
power the real Emperor might be expected to a certainty; if they
refused, the American show of force convinced them that grave trouble
would lie ahead, trouble which the Japanese, with their old-fashioned
fighting methods, could never successfully combat.</p>

<p>The most prominent personage in Japan at that moment was the Daimio
of Mito. He advocated absolute refusal of the American demands, and
the exclusion of all foreigners by force of arms, if necessary. He
recalled the famous wars of the past, and nearly every Daimio in the
country followed his lead. Forts were erected on the shore, the bells
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
of temples melted and made into cannon, and as many Samaurai as
possible were drilled with the most modern fire-arms procurable. They
got these through the Dutch at Nagasaki.</p>

<p>In the midst of this a Russian squadron appeared, also demanding a
treaty and the opening up of the country, but again no force was used.
Seven months after his first visit, Commodore Perry returned for his
answer, and the war fever having evaporated to some extent, a treaty
was actually signed on March 31, 1854.</p>

<p>This treaty provided for peace and goodwill between the United States
and Japan, the opening of Shimoda as a treaty port, and the similar
opening of Hakodate after an interval, the Americans agreeing that
their ships should visit no other ports except from necessity. The
other articles dealt with the care of shipwrecked mariners and the
like, and “the most favoured nation” clause. England, Russia, and
Holland soon secured similar treaties, Russia having the same ports as
America, England and Holland having Nagasaki instead of Shimoda.</p>

<p>All this split Japan into two hostile parties, the <i>Jo-i</i> and the
<i>Kai-koku</i>. The former, under the leadership of the Daimio of
Mito, were bitterly anti-foreign, and also desirous of restoring the
Emperor. The <i>Kai-koku</i>, on the other hand, supported the Shogun
action, and had as their watchword the words spoken by one of them at
the debate over Commodore Perry’s demands: “As we are not the equals of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
the foreigners in the mechanical arts, let us have intercourse with
foreign lands, let us learn their drill and tactics. Then, when we
shall have made our nation united as one family, we shall be able
to go abroad, and give lands in foreign countries to those who have
distinguished themselves in battle.”</p>

<p>For a time this party had the upper hand. Commercial treaties were
made, and by 1860 Ni-igata, Hyogo, and Yokohama had been opened, with
the Consuls of most nations established there. Ii-Kamon-no-kami,
head of the <i>Kai-Koku</i> party, imprisoned the Daimio of Mito,
and executed several Samaurai who had killed his adherents. Then, in
1860, on March 23, Ii-Kamon-no-kami was assassinated, and his party,
no longer with a powerful head, made isolated preparations for civil
war. Ships were purchased and manned by the retainers of the local
governors of provinces, and troops raised. Meanwhile the foreign
Legations were attacked, an American secretary was murdered, and other
foreigners injured. Other murders, notably that of an English merchant
named Richardson, followed, and an indemnity was refused. This led to
the arrival of Admiral Kuper with seven ships at Kagoshima, August 11,
1863. He bombarded the forts and city, and also sank or burned three
steamers belonging to the Daimio of Satsuma, whose men had committed
the murder. After this the indemnity was forthcoming, but the Daimio
promptly ordered more warships, and sent many of his naval officers to
Holland to learn European methods.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>In this same year the Daimio of Choshu, a member of the Jo-i, who had
also secured a small fleet for himself, fired upon an American steamer,
and afterwards upon the French gunboat Kienchang, which latter he
damaged severely. The Dutch frigate Medusa was also roughly handled by
his shore batteries at Shimonoseki, but replying, silenced them.</p>

<p>Both these acts led to reprisals. The United States warship Wyoming at
once proceeded to Shimonoseki, where she blew up one Japanese steam
warship, and sank a second, a small brig. The French warships Sémiramis
and Tancrède followed, and subjected Shimonoseki to a bombardment that
did considerable damage.</p>

<p>An indemnity was demanded and paid by the Shogun’s Government for these
attacks of foreign shipping, while the suppression of the Daimio of
Choshu at Shimonoseki was also promised. This, however, was a task
beyond the power of the Government, and finally the Powers interested
decided to take action. A combined fleet, consisting of nine British,
four Dutch, three French, and one hired United States steamer, went to
Shimonoseki to reduce this bar to passage on the Inland Sea.</p>

<p>The attacking vessels were:—

<p>The United States ship was merely chartered to indicate American
interest; all American vessels were then busy sinking each other in the
civil war.</p>

<p>This fleet left Yokohama on August 28, 1864, and from September 5th
to 9th it bombarded all the new forts that the Daimio had erected. At
the end of that time Shimonoseki surrendered unconditionally, and an
indemnity of three million dollars was claimed from the Shogun, and
eventually paid.</p>

<p>For the next two years the Shogun’s Government was busy trying
conclusions with the Daimio, but as he had raised a large force of the
common people, and drilled these in Western fashion, he easily held his
own. British and French troops meanwhile were permanently stationed at
Yokohama to guard foreign interests. Friction between these and the
<i>Jo-i</i> party was common, and more than one assassination took
place, but no naval demonstrations followed.

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span>
already recounted, the sight of foreign ships had gradually put
ideas of sea-power into the minds of the various governors of Japanese
provinces. One of the first, if not the first, ships to be acquired was
the Tsukuba, which still survives as a hulk. Her first name was the
Malacca, and she was launched in the United States in 1851. She was, in
her time, a fine-looking screw frigate of 1950 tons, carrying 20 guns,
and able to steam at the then satisfactory speed of 8 knots.</p>

<p>The Riaden, a small screw yacht of 370 tons, and the Chiyoda-nata
(Chiyoda type), of less than 140 tons, both schooner rigged, were
enrolled about the same time, and then followed by the Kasuga, a
two-funnelled, three-masted paddler, originally the Kiang-tse. She
carried six guns, and for some time served as the Shogun’s yacht.</p>

<p>Following this, the Fuji Yama, a full-rigged ship—a sailing frigate of
about 1010 tons and 24 guns—and the 523-ton barque-rigged sailing-ship
Ken-he were purchased.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>To learn how to work this naval militia, Japan imported instructors
of various kinds from the Western world. In response to applications,
the present Admiral Tracy was sent out by the British Government, and
with him a small host of other Westerners. With their natural aptitude,
the Japanese rapidly acquired the rudiments of sea service, while on
shore the beginnings of a shipbuilding yard were made at Yokosuka.
The British naval uniform was adopted with some slight differences.
Officers were sent to Europe—chiefly to Holland—to study the principles
of naval warfare, and at once a desire to possess ironclads arose.</p>

<p>Out of this came the purchase of Japan’s first ironclad, the Adsuma.</p>

The armour was 4½ to 4¾ ins. thick, and distributed on a complete
water-line belt and over both of the raised batteries. Though a very
famous vessel as the Stonewall Jackson, her war services under that
name were not extensive. She was built in France, and at the end
of 1864, when ready for sea, carried one large 13-in. 300-pounder
(smooth bore) in the bow, and the two 70-pounders (rifled) in the main
battery. No ship like her had ever been constructed before, and the
Confederates, to whom she then belonged, spread alarming reports as
to her power. Putting to sea, she reached Corunna in February, 1865,
and was there blockaded by the unarmoured Federal ships Niagara and
Sacramento. The former was a famous vessel in her way, of 5013 tons,
345 ft. long, 12-knot speed, and armed with twelve 11-in. smooth bores,
throwing a 135-lb. shell each. These guns were not able to fire shot
apparently, and the Sacramento was a weaker vessel. The Stonewall
Jackson challenged these two to a duel <i>à la</i> Kearsarge and
Alabama, but Craven, the Federal commodore, declined—wisely enough,
for he could not have done anything against the ironclad with his few
heavy pieces, while the ironclad would certainly have disabled and then
rammed him.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Consequently, the Stonewall Jackson did not smell powder on that
occasion, and the war ended very soon afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1866 a mysterious Japanese deputation came to America. Its object
was long unknown, but the curiosity it excited was sufficient to
cause telegraphic reports of its movements, and surmises as to its
intentions, to appear in the London <i>Times</i> every now and again.
Finally came the news that “the Japanese deputation have come to buy
ironclads”—a statement at first treated as a joke.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The Japanese do not, however, appear to have been large bidders
for the forty odd ironclads that America then had to dispose of. Few
of these “on sale” craft were fit for a sea voyage—they were merely
hastily constructed monitors intended more often than not for river
service. The Stonewall Jackson, however, being a sea-going ship, was
purchased for the Shogun, and re-named Adsuma.</p>

<p>A gunboat or two changed hands at this period, and altogether
the various Japanese governors collected between them a small,
heterogeneous fleet, the very existence of which was scarcely known
outside their own country. Indeed, twenty years later comparatively
few people knew, and still fewer cared, that Japan possessed a navy at all.</p>

<p>The Adsuma has long been removed from the effective list and
relegated to hulk duty. On account of her enormous ram, she was
somewhat of a curio to naval visitors for many years, and the most
vivid memory retained by some of our people of the harbour in which the
Adsuma lay was the fashion in which the Japanese sailors used her ram.
They walked down over it into the water when bathing.</p>

<p>Of the smaller vessels previously referred to the following may be
mentioned:—</p>

<p>No. 1 Tébo was a swan-bow, three-masted, schooner-rigged screw
steamer of 250 tons only. Two or three other ships like her existed.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
The Unyo, built at Amsterdam, was little larger—295 tons only. She was
a brig-rigged and ram-bowed screw steamer, carrying three pivot guns
(Krupp’s), disposed in the centre line, as were the three big guns in
the French Baudin and Formidable till these ships were reconstructed.
The Unyo was wrecked many years ago.</p>

<p>The Moisshin, screw gunboat of 357 tons, is worthy of more attention,
as she was the first ship ever built in Japan since the days of
Adams. She was an enlarged edition of No. 1 Tébo, and exactly like
her in appearance. Between the funnel and foremast a single Long Tom
was carried. She was launched somewhere about the year 1865. Her
construction was not, of course, purely Japanese—she was a craft upon
which the Islanders practised and learnt construction with important
material.</p>

<p>The Setsu, 935 tons, 8 guns, a sailing frigate, and the Chio-bin, a
barque of 650 tons, originally used for trading purposes, also belong
to this early period.</p>

<p>So also does a ship with more history, the Asama, a composite
sailing-ship of 1445 tons and 14 guns. Her exact early history is
shrouded in some mystery, but just previous to her entry into the
Japanese fleet she was the property of a too-confiding pirate, who went
into a Japanese harbour to refit, and had his ship taken possession
of by the Japanese in consequence. The ship still exists as a gunnery
hulk, and carries, or did till recently, eight 7-in. breech-loaders and
four 4½-in. muzzle-loaders.</p>

<p>With these ships, built and building, Japan found herself engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
in that civil war of which the Mikasa, Asama, and other ships of
to-day are the direct outcome. The officers had had some years of
Western training, chiefly in Holland and Denmark. The accompanying
<a href="#P_030">illustration</a>, from a Japanese photograph,
indicates the uniform of the period. There were in the Navy in those
days two schools—the party of progress and those opposed to change—by
no means necessarily identical with the same political parties. Indeed,
of the two, the <i>Jo-i</i> seem to have chiefly availed themselves
of the war-training to be secured from the foreigners whose expulsion
was one of their political tenets. This, perhaps, was due in part or
in great measure to the other factor in the dispute—the question as to
whether the Emperor or the Shogun and his representatives should be
ruler of the country. This became eventually the sole question.</p>

In 1867 the Emperor Kōmei died, and was succeeded by his son,
the present Emperor, Mutsohito, then a boy. His advisers had by
now concluded that the anti-foreign agitation was a mistake, and
thence forward it was only carried on by a few isolated Daimios. The
real problem was one of ruling, and this culminated in 1867 by the
Shogun resigning his power, and becoming a species of minister.</p>

<p>The adherents of neither party were favourably disposed towards this
middle course; and ultimately civil war, in which the ex-Shogun’s party
were continually defeated, resulted.</p>

<p>The ironclad Adsuma was in the hands of the Imperialists, as also
were most of the other warships; but the ex-Shogun had owned seven
ships, mounting between them 83 guns, and these Yenomoto, his admiral
(one of the Dutch-trained officers) absolutely refused to surrender.
Chased by Nahamoto, the Imperial admiral, he took refuge in Hakodate,
where the remnants of the rebels had collected. A naval action
resulted disastrously for Yenomoto. In July, 1869, the rebels finally
surrendered, and Japan entered upon a new era, in which much of the
power hitherto wielded by the Daimios passed into the hands of the
Samaurai, whose descendants now supply the bulk of naval and military
officers, retaining all the courage of their fierce ancestors, and
more of their exclusiveness than is generally supposed. But further
particulars under this head will be found in a later
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

the sea fight off Hakodate the civil war ended. The feudal fleets
were abolished, and all ships were enrolled in an Imperial Navy—a
proceeding that, of course, increased its strength. Some reorganisation
of <i>personnel</i> was also effected, bringing the Navy more into line
with the Western model.</p>

<p>Naval advisers came and went. They included, during the period
1865-1885, the present British admirals Tracy and Hopkins, the eminent
French naval architect M. Bertin, and finally Captain Ingles, R.N., of
whom more will be found in the Appendix.</p>

The horse-power was 975 nominal, the speed 9 knots. She was
single-screwed, and carried 350 tons of coal. Like all the early
sea-going ironclads, she had a 4½-in. iron armour belt, and 4 inches
over the amidship battery. The heaviest gun was carried in the bow on

In the year 1875, or thereabouts, the Japanese finally decided to
embark upon a war navy, and laid the foundations of that fleet which
some twenty years later was to vindicate its existence at Yalu and
Wei-hei-wei. In that year a then modern ironclad, up-to-date ironclad,
and two armoured cruisers, on what was then the best accepted model,
were ordered.</p>

<p>Of these the Fu-So,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
designed by Sir E. J. Reed, and launched at Samuda’s Yard, Poplar,
England, in 1877, was then a powerful second-class battleship. In
design she resembles the French Rédoutable, though of only half her
size. Particulars are:—</p>

<p>In 1879 began what later events constituted the supplementary Japanese
shipbuilding programme. In 1879 Elswick built for China those once
famous “alphabetical gunboats,” a series of “flat-irons” of the Rendel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
type, to carry one gun. Like a good many other Chinese vessels, they
were destined to fly the Japanese flag at a later period of their
existence. Altogether there were eleven of these craft, named after
letters of the Greek alphabet, but re-named by the Chinese. They were
named Lung-shang (Alpha), he-wei (Beta), Fei-ting (Gamma), Tche-tien
(Delta), the first two of 340 tons, the other two of 420 tons, and
which the Chinese still own. The remainder are a little larger, four,
Cheng-tung (Epsilon), Chen-Sei (Zeta), Chen-nan (Eta), Chen-pei (Theta),
of 490 tons, and Chin-pen (Kappa), Hai-chang-ching (Lambda), and
Chen-chung (Iota) of 500 tons. Japan now owns all of this last batch,
except the Hai-chang-ching.</p>

<p>Gamma and Delta carry a 38-ton Armstrong M.L.; all the others are armed
with the 11-in. 25-ton gun. Horse-power varies from 235 in the smaller
craft to 472 in the larger. There are slight differences in dimensions,
but the largest only runs to 125 ft. long by 29 ft. broad. Two other
rather smaller gunboats once existed, but these the French sunk at
Foochow in the early eighties. The development of small guns has long
since rendered this type of gunboat useless; but, apart from that, the bad
care taken of them by the Chinese would have made them of no service.</p>

<p class="spa2">China in 1881 was making some considerable efforts towards
being a naval power, efforts that continued till 1889, when they suddenly
died out, or resolved themselves into the building of small craft by
Chinamen. A Chino-Japanese war was a possibility in 1881 as much as in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
1890. Neither side was, however, ready for the conflict, and in
the early eighties Japan’s energies were concentrated on training
<i>personnel</i>, China’s on acquiring <i>materiel</i>. In 1881 the
latter had launched for her the big ironclad Ting Yuen at Stettin,
followed a little later by the Chin Yuen, now in the Japanese service.
From the time China first had them, Japan coveted these ironclads; by
the irony of fate, she did not secure them (or rather the one that was
left) till far superior ships of her own were on the stocks.</p>

<p>The Tung Yuen sank at Wei-hai-wei during the war; the Chen Yuen, her
sister, was taken at the same time. Her details are:—</p>

<p>The arrangement of the heavy armament is upon the system that in 1880
was held to be the system of the future—four big guns able to fire
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
end-on or on the broadside. The ideal warship of those days was to
fight in line abreast. The advantages of that disposition were seen,
while its disadvantages were ignored. It was not realised how easily
an enemy could get round upon either flank and mask the fire of nearly
all the units in this cumbersome formation, the advantages of which lie
only in going into action against an enemy right ahead.</p>

<p>When the Chin Yen was the Chinese Chen Yuen she carried thin shields
over her big guns. The 6-in. pieces were in the extreme bow and stern,
each in a 3-in. turret. The big gun shields were removed before the
war. The Japanese captured these with Port Arthur, and have since
replaced them. They have also mounted a 6-in. Q.F. in the bow turret,
substituted a 6-in. Q.F. behind a shield for the after turret, and
mounted two additional Q.F.’s upon sponsons specially built near the
mainmast. Two 6-pounder Q.F. and a number of 3- or 2½-pounders have
also been added on the upper deck. The <a href="#P_051">photograph</a>
shows the ship as she now is.</p>

<p>The armour of the Chin Yen is distributed as follows: Amidships for
150 ft. is a 14-in. compound belt. Under-water and at the end of it
this belt thins to 10 ins. Forward and aft of it is a protective deck
3 ins. thick. The ends of the belt are joined by flat bulkheads of 14
ins. Rising from this redoubt are the barbettes, 12 ins. compound.
The starboard one is forward, the port somewhat aft of it.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The big gun hoods are quite thin, 4 ins. or less; between the big guns
in the conning-tower, 8 ins. in thickness.

The ship, it will be seen, is of the British Ajax or Colossus
type—very much a “soft ender.” She is, however, given a good deal of
protection in the way of specially arranged watertight compartments,
and there is also a species of cofferdam.</p>

<p>In 1881 Elswick set afloat the Arturo Prat, a small cruiser originally
intended for Chili, but subsequently purchased by Japan and re-named
Tsukushi. China had two sisters built at the same time, the Tchao Yong
and Yang-wei, both of which were sunk at Yalu. Particulars of the
Tsukushi are as follows:—</p>

The ship is practically a sister to the Kaimon. The engines of both
were made at Yokosuka, and are of the same type. Both ships have swan
bows, one funnel, and are barque-rigged. The sterns are rather square.</p>

<p>In 1884 Elswick suddenly sprang the deck-protected cruiser on the
world. In that year was launched the famous Esmeralda. She was, like
the Arturo Prat, built for Chili, and as a Chilian cruiser bore a
share in the Chilian revolution. When the Chino-Japanese war broke out
Japan made overtures for this ship, and in 1895 purchased her through
the agency of Ecuador. The war was over before the cruiser could be
employed, but she was probably purchased against possible eventualities
with Russia, France, and Germany. Being now obsolete, she has not
proved a valuable acquisition, and the Japanese speak of her as a very
bad sea boat. Particulars of this once famous vessel are:—</p>

<p>As before, Yokosuka made the horizontal compound engines, and in the
Katsuragi twin screws were attempted for the first time. These ships
are now employed for training squadron duties. They have clipper bows,
and are, generally speaking, small editions of the British Raleigh.
They are all three barque-rigged. The Mushashi is distinguished by a
red band, the Katsuragi a yellow one.</p>

<p>The “warship Naniwa-kan,” as she used to be called in England, in
defiance to all explanations to the effect that the affix “kan”
simply meant “warship,” attained a good deal of celebrity while under
construction. The British Navy had then no ships like her, and the
Mersey class, then building, though more heavily gunned on about the
same displacement, were popularly considered very poor substitutes,
since their biggest guns were 8-in. pieces only, against the Naniwa’s
10-in. The big gun had at that time a very great hold on popular imagination.</p>

    <p class="center">(<i>This is the cruiser that sunk the Kow-shing.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Note.</b>—The sinking of the Kow-shing will
be found described in the chapter on the Chino-Japanese war. Special
interest attaches to the Naniwa on account of the fact that during this
war she was commanded by the present Admiral Togo.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
As originally rigged, the Naniwa and Takachiho carried a top on
each mast. After the war, in which they did not exhibit the best of
sea-keeping qualities, these tops were lowered, and light platforms
erected where they used to be, as in the <a href="#P_063">illustration</a>.
The old rig, which is tolerably familiar, will be noticed in the
illustrations dealing with the war. The Naniwa and Takachiho both
took part in the first engagement at Asan; the Naniwa subsequently
made her name familiar to the world over the Kow-shing affair. Both
ships participated at Yalu and Wei-hai-wei. The Naniwa was launched
on March 18, 1885, at Elswick, the Takachiho on May 16th in the same
year. In appearance the two craft are almost absolutely identical; for
convenience, and to enable their own officers to distinguish them, the
Takachiho has a red band round her instead of the orthodox black one.
As a further guide, she carries a couple of signal yards on the main,
in place of the single yard carried there by the Naniwa.</p>

compound, thus rendering it proof against any of the 10-in. guns afloat
in the Japanese Fleet at the time she was built. Indeed, at Yalu there
were only three guns present in the Japanese Fleet against which the
Tche-Yuen’s turret armour was not proof. However, the possession of a
little impenetrable armour is of small service to a warship—the odds
being always against any one particular spot being hit. At Asan, in
which the Tche-Yuen suffered rather severely, none of the Japanese guns
against her were able to pierce this forward turret.

In 1879 Japan had already had four torpedo boats built for her at
Yarrow’s. These craft displaced only 40 tons. In 1886, however,
Yarrow’s built the first-class twin-screw torpedo boat Kotaka. This
boat is remarkable as the first armoured torpedo boat ever constructed.
She has 1-in. steel plating all over her machinery compartment, and the
subdivision of the hull is, for a torpedo boat, singularly complete. In
her way the Kotaka was the forerunner of the destroyers, being larger
than the run of torpedo boats even now. Full details of her are:—</p>

<p>The torpedo tubes are thus disposed: two forward, firing right ahead,
a pair amidships, and another pair a little abaft of them. The Kotaka
made a name for herself in the war, and previously to that was a
successful craft. However, for some reason Japan had no more boats from
Yarrow, or, indeed, from England, for the next ten years, the next, a
batch of fourteen, being ordered from Creusot. These were launched in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
1889. The Kotaka, after being built, was sent out to Japan in sections,
and there put together again. The Creusot boats were sent out in
similar fashion, while a further seven were put together entirely at
Kobé, in Japan. All these boats were small ones of 56 tons, 114½ ft.
long, 10½ ft. beam, and 6 ft. draught. With 525 I.H.P., they made 20
knots on trial. They have two torpedo tubes, carry two 1-pounder Q.F.,
a complement of 16 men, and are single screw. One of them was lost
off the Pescadores in December, 1895, and a couple at Wei-hai-wei in
February of the same year.</p>

<p>Japan still continued the construction of other craft, having launched
the Maya<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
at Onohama in 1886, the Akagi<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
at the same yard in 1887, the Atago<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
at Yokosuka in 1887, and the Chiokai<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
at Tokio in the same year. The Maya and Chiokai were, as before,
composite, but the other two are noteworthy as being constructed
entirely of steel. A large proportion of the material for them was
imported, and the building was rather a case of merely putting together.</p>

In appearance and armament they vary much. The Maya carries a couple of
6-in. Krupp’s, with two 3-pounder Q.F. and a couple of machine guns;
the Chiokai and Atago are armed with one 8-in. Krupp and one 4.7-in.
gun and two machine guns; the Akagi carries two special French guns of
about 4.7-in. calibre. These guns are the only ones of the kind in the
world, and singularly powerful pieces—Hebrieu guns. The objection to
them is that their lives are short. They proved too powerful for the
little Akagi, and shook her up badly on trial. They were afterwards
fired with reduced charges, except at Yalu, where they proved very
useful, owing to their power.</p>

<p>The Akagi has a raised forecastle, the other three have not. All used
to be schooner-rigged, but just before the war a fighting-top was
fitted to the Akagi’s foremast, and a crow’s-nest to her main. To
distinguish them, the Maya has a black band, the Chiokai a red one,
the Atago yellow. The Akagi’s band is black, but her forecastle and
fighting-top distinguish her. In addition, she has a rather elaborate
green scrollwork on the bow. She has also sponsons for her machine
guns. At Yalu this ship lost her mainmast, and the damage was left
unrepaired for a long time in deference to naval sentiment; it has,
however, been replaced lately.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p class="spa2">Reference has already been made to the transfer of
torpedo-boat building from British to French firms. M. Bertin was at
that time naval adviser to the Japanese Government, consequently French
design for large ships secured a similar victory in the year 1887-8.
With such ships as she now had, Japan was beginning to be able to stand
alone, many English instructors were dispensed with; but she was yet
some distance from her present independence. French enterprise saw its
chance and took it; all the foreign-built ships of the new programme
came from France.</p>

<p>These were the Itsukushima, Matsushima, and Hashidate (this last put
together in Japan), the Unebi, Tschishima, and some smaller ships (laid
down in Japanese yards), Yayeyama, Oshima, and Takao.</p>

<p>The ships built in Japan during the Bertin <i>régime</i>, 1887 to 1890,
are distinctly French in design and appearance. The first to take the
water was the Takao, launched at Yokosuka in 1888. Particulars are:—</p>

<p>About 1887 Japan definitely decided to draw all her Q.F. guns, 6-in. or
4.7-in., from Elswick, and all heavy guns from Canet. Krupp’s pieces
were discarded. This resolution was adhered to till 1902-03, so far as
Elswick was concerned, but Canet guns were given up some years ago.
Elswick guns were, in 1890, shipped to France for the Itsukushima and
her sister. At present (1904) new guns are on the Vickers model.

There is no protection to the machinery. The engines were built at
Yokosuka.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, shipbuilding abroad had been proceeding apace, but disaster
attended both the earlier vessels. The first, the Unebi, a cruiser of
3650 tons, with four 6-in. Q.F. as her principal armament, mysteriously
disappeared while on her way out to Japan<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and still in the contractors’ hands. Her loss was officially attributed
to instability, and seems to have inspired the Japanese authorities
with a profound distrust for French shipbuilding; at any rate, the
Chiyoda, a vessel generally resembling the lost Unebi, was given to
Thomson Yard at Clydebank for construction. She will be described in
due course later on.</p>

<p>The second French-built ship, upon the same general plan as the
French Milan and Japanese Yayeyama, was the Tschishima, of 750 tons
displacement. In appearance she was nearly identical to the French
Milan. She met with disaster in the Inland Sea almost immediately after
the Japanese took her over (1892), and all her crew were drowned. The
Tatsuta was ordered from Elswick to replace her.</p>

<p>The Itsukushima, the first of the “Bertin cruisers,” so-called after
their designer, was launched at La Seyne in 1889. Captain Ingles, R.N.,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
naval adviser to the Japanese, had strongly persuaded them against
ironclads; they had been advised against the big gun also. However,
they were bent on mounting a gun able to pierce any armour in the
Chinese Navy or in foreign warships likely to come to the Far East.
By the irony of fate, these big guns contributed nothing to the
victory of the Yalu; however, the decision of the Japanese to have
them cannot be condemned, in view of the fact that naval construction
everywhere in ’88 was based upon the big gun. Having a full idea of
their requirements, the Japanese settled upon the Italian Lepanto as
embodying the most useful type of ship for them, and the Itsukushimas
were ordered on that principle.</p>

For protection there is a steel deck 1½ ins. thick on the slopes. With
this is associated a cellulose belt and coal protection. The total
protection, so far as penetration is concerned, is not, however, more
than equivalent to what a 6-in. belt of old iron armour would afford,
and it would keep out nothing above a 4.7-in. shot, and that only at
long ranges. Over the engine hatches is a patch of thick steel armour.</p>

<p>The heavy gun barbette is a strip of 12-in. Creusot steel, with a 4-in.
steel shield over the breech of the gun. There is an armoured hoist
that affords some support, but, speaking generally, the gun is more or
less at the mercy of shell bursting underneath it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>The Hashidate was built from the same designs at Yokosuka, and is
practically identical with the Itsukushima, save that the battery guns
aft are in small unarmoured sponsons, and obtain thereby a slightly
greater angle of fire. She is further distinguished by a red band; the
Itsukushima, being the first of the class, has, of course, a black band.</p>

<p>Grave doubts were soon entertained as to the seaworthiness of these
two ships, and the Matsushima being a little more behindhand than the
others, her design was altered. She carries the big gun aft, which
makes her a better sea boat. The battery is shifted forward in the
main deck. In place of the single 4.7-in. that her companions carry in
the stern, the raised fok’s’le of the Matsushima contains two of these
pieces, firing through recessed port.</p>

<p>Her small quickfiring armament is also different, there being sixteen
3-pounders.</p>

<p>All three ships have a single tripod mast abaft the funnel, with a
couple of tops on it. Each now carries three signal yards.</p>

<p>The Itsukushima was launched on July 11, 1889, and commissioned in
Japan in 1891. The Matsushima, launched on January 22, 1890, went out
in 1892. The Hashidate was not launched till March 24, 1891, but early
in 1893 she was in commission.</p>

<p>It had been hoped that these ships would attain speeds of 17.5 knots;
none of them, however, ever reached it.

<p>In 1891 Japan had built for her by Normand at Le Havre a 75-ton torpedo
boat, 118 ft. long, two tubes, and a trial speed of 23 knots. She is a
twin-screw boat.</p>

<p>Two other boats, 90-tonners, were also launched in Germany at Elbing.
Length, 128 ft.; trial speed, 23 knots; one screw; armament, three
tubes and three 1-pounder Q.F.</p>

<p>China in 1890 launched a home-built diminutive of the Itsukushima, the
Ping Yuen. The Japanese took her at Wei-hai-wei, but she has never
been of any use to them, and she now does duty as a gunnery hulk.

<p>The old 6-in. Krupp are now replaced by a couple of 45-calibre Elswick
6-in. Q.F. for drill purposes. The old 10-in. gun remains, and,
being always cocked up in the air at an extreme elevation, is the
most noticeable and characteristic feature of this ship, which every
Japanese regards as a standing joke. An enormous dragon adorns each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
broadside. Japanese officers who come to Portsmouth always, by the way,
christen our Hero “the British Ping Yen.”</p>

<p>The Ping Yuen was begun as a 16-knot, 2850-ton ship, a copy in fine
of the Stettin-built King Yuen. In an early stage of construction,
however, her length was much reduced, <i>for economical reasons</i>.
She appears to have had much the same machinery as the King Yuen
originally. This, however, was tinkered in fitting, and some of her
boilers were stolen, or otherwise dispensed with! On trial she made
10.5 knots for a short period, but, after being taken care of by the
Chinese, soon sank below that modest speed. It is doubtful whether she
made as much as 6 knots at Yalu.</p>

<p>There is a 2-in. steel protective deck in places; amidships and under
water there is a small patch of 8-in. compound armour. The barbette is
a 5-in. strip of armour; the conning-tower has the same thickness. A
thin shield—removed during the war—covers the big gun.</p>

<p>On June 3, 1890, the third-class cruiser Chiyoda, built to replace the
lost Unebi, took the water at Clydebank. Particulars of her are as
follows:—</p>

She was the first ship in any navy to be fitted with water-tube
boilers, which were barely coming into existence in those days. Hers
are of the Belleville type.</p>

<p>For protection she depends on a 4¼-in. chrome steel armour belt, 200
ft. long, amidships. Forward and aft of this is a protective deck
1½ ins. thick on the slopes. Throughout the entire water-line is a
cellulose belt, and she is divided into 84 watertight compartments. The
guns have no protection beyond the ordinary shields. They are, however,
very well disposed.</p>

<p>In 1898 she was practically re-boilered, the old tubes being replaced
by some specially large ones, in order to enable her to burn Japanese
coal, which sooted the ordinary tubes.</p>

<p>In 1890 the Akitsushima was laid down at Yokosuka. It was at first
supposed that she was a sister to the Matsushima. The Yoshino was
contracted for at Elswick towards the end of this year. Both were
launched in 1892, and commissioned just before the war with China.</p>

<p>The Akitsushima was the last ship to be built in Japan with imported
material. She is practically a small copy of the U.S.S. Baltimore.

<p>The Akitsushima mounts 6-in. guns in the foremost and aftermost
sponsons; four 4.7-in. are carried amidships, the fifth on the
forecastle, and the sixth astern. She has thus a broadside fire of
two 6-in. and four 4.7-in., against two 8-in. and three 6-in. in the
Baltimore. Assuming that ship’s guns to be now replaced by Q.F., the
Akitsushima would bring the equivalent of a 6-in. gun less.</p>

<p>The normal coal supply, at 4150 tons displacement, is about 400 tons.
Bunkers are disposed amidships in the usual fashion above the armour
deck. Amidships this deck is 4½ ins. thick on the slopes (= <i>c</i>)
and 2 ins. on the flat. Allowing for the additional resistance of the
coal, nothing under a 10-in., or modern 9.2 or 9.4-in., could penetrate
to the engine-room, and then only with solid shot. The watertight
compartments are exceptionally numerous. With natural draught the ship
has made 21.6 knots.</p>

<p>The 6-in. guns are thus distributed: one on the forecastle, one on the
poop, the other two in the foremost sponsons. The other broadside guns
are 4.7-in. and 3-pounders. The bow and stern chasers have an arc of
fire of 270 degrees, the 6-in. guns in sponsons fire 3 degrees across
the bow and 60 degrees abaft it.

The aftermost 4.7-in. fire 3 degrees across the stern and 60 degrees
before it. The broadside guns have an arc of about 120 degrees. Each
of the fighting-tops carries a couple of 3-pounder Q.F., four on each
bridge, two under the forecastle forward, two under the poop well aft,
the remaining six between the guns amidships.</p>

<p class="spa2">Towards the end of 1893 a violent agitation against
the Navy filled the Japanese newspapers. The existing types of
ships—particularly the Chiyoda and Itsukushima class—were unfavourably
criticised. The <i>personnel</i> was not free from these attacks; it
was in some quarters demonstrated useless and inefficient. In the midst
of these attacks the war with China loomed and broke out. After that
war nothing further was heard on the subject of the <i>personnel’s</i>
“defects.”</p>

<p>The primary result of the agitation was a new shipbuilding programme.
The only ships actually under construction at that time were the Suma,
building at Yokosuka, and laid down in March, 1893, and the Tatsuta,
ordered to replace the lost Tschishima, building at Elswick. The new
programme embodied “two first-class battleships of the most powerful
type,” a cruiser at Yokosuka of the Suma type, and a sloop Miyako, laid
down at Kuré in 1894. This programme was also a subject of attack in a
portion of the Japanese press.</p>

<p>Before, however, anything could be done, the battle of Asan and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
affair of the Kow-shing precipitated the war with China. Consequently,
on the outbreak of war, the Tatsuta, launched at Elswick on April 6,
1894, and hastily completed in August of the same year, was stopped as
contraband on her way out at Aden.</p>

<p>The Tatsuta is a torpedo gunboat. Particulars as follows:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br> THE WAR WITH CHINA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japan</span>
was not long in finding uses for her navy.</p>

<p>The massacre of some shipwrecked Japanese in Formosa led to the
despatch of a punitive expedition, the expense of which was paid by
China, the suzerain, without any too much goodwill.</p>

<p>In 1875 Koreans gave trouble, by attacking a Japanese steamer that had
visited one of their ports for coal and provisions, and in the midst of
wild excitement a fleet was despatched, which, however, accomplished
its object without bloodshed. A commercial treaty was concluded, and
Japanese influences once more begun to gain ground in the Hermit
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the Satsuma clan, whose anti-foreign
sentiments had brought them into conflict with the British ten years
before. A large portion of this clan were still violently conservative,
and Saigo, the then head, having retired from Tokio, set up military
schools, which something like 20,000 young Samaurai entered. Owing to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
his known reactionary ideas, Saigo was naturally viewed with some
suspicion, but it is questionable whether he was at first imbued with
anything but a strong imperialism. Amongst other things, he advocated
the seizure of Korea, which, at that time, could have been done without
much opposition, if any, from Russia, then busy over her war with
Turkey. The Russian danger crusade was not, however, taken seriously
by the people at large, and Saigo, in preaching war with Russia, was
regarded as a visionary, crying “wolf” where no wolf was to be found.</p>

<p>On the other hand, war with China was a foregone conclusion for a
long time before it occurred. Both China and Japan wanted Korea, and
while China claimed a suzerainty over Korea, Japan insisted that it
was an independent State. On account of this, strained relations were
continual.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1894 an insurrection broke out in Korea, and China,
to indicate her suzerainty, despatched troops to quell it. At the
same time she sent a Note to the Japanese Government, notifying her
intentions, using the term “tributary State” for Korea.</p>

<p>Japan replied by a Note, refusing to accept the “tributary State”
expression, and a little later announced her intention of sending
4000 troops to Korea—claiming this as her right under the Chemulpo
Convention—which specified that if China sent troops to Korea, Japan
might do the like.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>China protested, and, after the exchange of many Notes, despatched ten
transports full of troops from Taku between July 21 and July 23. She also
sent to Asan in Korea the small cruiser Tche Yuen and the gunboat Kuang-ki.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span></p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF ASAN<br> (PHUNG-DO).</h3>

<p>On July 25th the Chinese warships Tche Yuen (Tsi Yuen)<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and Kwang-Yi (Kuang King), coming from Asan in Korea, with awnings up,
and generally unprepared for action, encountered off the island of
Phung-do a portion of the Japanese flying squadron, consisting of the
Naniwa (Captain Togo),<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Yoshino (Captain Kawara), and Akitsushima (Captain Kamimura), the
Yoshino flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Tsuboi.</p>

<p>Many accounts of this action have been written. The one I give here
differs in many details from the narrative currently accepted; however,
it is based on the personal narratives to me of officers of the
Japanese ships engaged, and appears to me to afford by far the most
reasonable explanation as to how the fight came about.</p>

<p>The Tche Yuen was never a good steering ship, and her steering-gear,
which had been for some time in a state of neglect, broke down just
about the time the Japanese ships were sighted.</p>

<p>This caused her to alter her course, and she bore down upon the
Japanese, coming nearer and nearer. The idea went round that she
purposed torpedoing.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Every gun in the Japanese fleet was thereupon laid upon the Tche Yuen’s
conning-tower, red flags hoisted, and the Chinese ships ordered to keep
off. This the leading vessel, Tche Yuen (Captain Fong), was unable to
do, and she pressed so closely on the Naniwa that Captain Togo turned
and headed towards her.</p>

<p>The Tche Yuen hoisted a white flag, but still continued to approach.
Thereupon the Naniwa opened fire, the other ships following suit. The
Japanese version, that the Tche Yuen fired a torpedo first of all,
while under the white flag, generally credited, is, on the evidence of
Japanese officers, quite incorrect. No torpedo was fired; they expected
one—that is all.</p>

<p>The conning-tower of the Tche Yuen was hit five times at the first
discharge, the first lieutenant and a sub-lieutenant, who were inside,
being killed, though the captain, who stood beside them, was unhurt.
He vacated the tower, and gave orders to clear for action. In the
circumstances he made a very passable fight for it, despite the
subsequent Chinese allegations of cowardice. Caught unprepared, his
fighting did not amount to much; but that was a natural sequel to his
unpreparedness.</p>

<p>Long before the Chinese could reply, the Japanese, at 3000 yards, had
practically put the ship <i>hors de combat</i>. A large shell hit the
armour-deck, and glancing up, struck the fore-turret, disabling one of
the 8-in. guns. All men on deck were killed, wounded, or driven away,
and in a little while the fore-turret was again hit and the gun’s crews
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
killed. A shell burst in the funnel base, killing or wounding men in
the stokehold, and all the upper works were riddled.</p>

<p>At about this stage the Tche Yuen did what she should have done long
before, got the hand-steering wheel going, and, this done, she made
off for Wei-hai-wei, keeping up a mild fire on the Japanese ships from
her after 6-in. gun. This retreat was the only thing she could do; to
remain would have been madness.</p>

<p>The Japanese attempted no pursuit, despite Chinese stories to the
contrary. They believed that the Chinese battle-fleet was near by, and
were chary accordingly. The only hit obtained by the Tche Yuen was on
the Yoshino’s bridge, and this did little harm. On the other hand, the
Tche Yuen, though she lost three officers and thirteen men killed, and
twenty-five wounded, was not seriously damaged structurally, for within
a week she was repaired. She, however, looked a fearful wreck; and an
idea obtains that the Japanese thought that the sight of her would have
a strong moral effect on the Chinese, which to some extent it did. If
so, it was no unwise move; the ship, sound or damaged, could never be a
serious enemy to them.</p>

<p>While this was going on the Kuang-Yi, disregarding orders to retire,
attempted to charge and torpedo the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
In this, of course, she failed, and, being on fire, most of her crew
killed or wounded, she ran ashore. What was left of her crew—eighteen
men all told—reached the land. The Naniwa, which had engaged the
gunboat, continued to pound her, till a torpedo in the stern-tube blew
up, and practically destroyed her completely.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
This battle, save that it began the war, was a quite unimportant event,
and has never been regarded in the Japanese Navy for more than it is
worth. It is chiefly interesting on account of the pluck exhibited by
the Chinese captain of the Kuang-Yi, and for the fact that in it Togo
of the Naniwa first came to the front.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span></p>

<h3>SINKING OF THE KOW-SHING</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
Battle of Asan began at 7.5 a.m. on July 25, 1894. It was well over
when, at 8.30 a.m., the British-owned transport Kow-shing was sighted in
the distance, and at 9.15 a.m. the Naniwa fired two blank charges at
her and signalled to her to stop.</p>

<p>The Kow-shing was perfectly well known to the Japanese, Lieutenant
Kuroi, of the Intelligence Department, having informed his Government
on July 14th that she was chartered as a transport for Chinese troops.
She was commanded by Captain Galsworthy of the British mercantile
marine, and had on board, besides her officers and crew of 64 men, 1100
Chinese soldiers and the German Von Hannacken, who was in the Chinese
service.</p>

<p>The Naniwa ordered the Kow-shing to follow her, and to this capture
the captain assented, but the Chinese on board insisted on returning
to Taku instead. Four hours were spent in negotiations, at the end of
which time Captain Togo advised the Europeans in the Kow-shing to leave.
Before this was complied with the Chinese were in a state of mutiny,
and Togo, dreading the arrival of the Chinese battle-fleet, gave the
order to open fire on the transport. At 1.10 p.m. he fired a torpedo,
which missed, and a broadside that hit the Kow-shing in the engine-room.
Five minutes later she began to sink, and at 1.46 went under.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Most of the European officers jumped overboard, and the majority were
rescued by the Naniwa’s boats. The Chinese on board the sinking ship
opened a heavy rifle-fire on everything and everybody. The story that
the Japanese fired on the men in the water does not appear to have
any foundation in fact. The statement that they did so rests on the
authority of the German Von Hannacken, who was hardly in a position
to observe the exact facts as he swam to safety. It is probable, and,
indeed, to be presumed, that the men on the Naniwa’s tops fired at the
Kow-shing, in order to keep down the fire which the Chinese soldiers
directed at the Japanese boats sent to pick up the European survivors.</p>

<p>About half the Chinese were picked up by a French gunboat or escaped
to the islands; no attempt to save any was made by the Japanese. For
this they have received stronger condemnation than they merit. To risk
being killed by one lot of the enemy in order to save another lot
is not a necessary act in war ethics. This was Captain Togo’s view,
situated as he was in a position of considerable danger, owing to the
supposed propinquity of the Chinese fleet. From panic, or the idea that
the Japanese would give no quarter, the Chinese had to all intents
and purposes gone mad <i>en masse</i>; and whatever theories armchair
critics may evolve, the amount of blame actually due to Captain Togo is of
a trifling nature. He had to choose between two evils, and chose the least.</p>

<p>The legality of the attack on the Kow-shing was hotly contested; but in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
the end it was established that Japan was inside her legal rights. As
to the ethics of the matter—well, the moralist who objects is apt to
fail to realise that the Kow-shing carried 1100 of the best soldiers
China could put in the field, and they had been destined to fight
the Naniwa’s countrymen. To allow them to proceed would have been a
splendid exhibition of legal-mindedness, but it would also have been a
criminally stupid act from the patriotic standpoint.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span></p>

<h3>SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">After</span>
this there was a lull. The Chinese battle-fleet, led by Admiral
Ting in the Ting Yuen, put to sea searching for the Japanese. Ting
was anxious to fight, and his <i>personnel</i> was in a good state of
efficiency; his <i>materiel</i> was otherwise. Still, at this early
stage, had he encountered the Japanese fleet, he was far more likely to
have destroyed it than he was later on.</p>

<p>He had, however, to reckon with Li Hung Chang and Loh Feng Lo. These
presently ordered him not to cruise east of Wei-hai-wei and the Yalu
river; and this order practically put the Chinese fleet out of the
operations. It has been stated many times that Li Hung Chang was bribed
by the Japanese to give this order, and it is possible that he was. It
is more probable, however, that for the Chinese to be defeated was a
part of his own peculiar policy.</p>

<p>For some time, therefore, nothing happened. The Japanese feinted at
Wei-hai-wei and Port Arthur, but for a good six weeks they spent most
of their time in sea work—drilling and preparing for battle. The
Chinese ships, on the other hand, lay inactive, steadily deteriorating
morally, as inactive ships must.</p>

<p>It was stated in Japan that British cruisers at this time acted as
Chinese scouts, giving information as to Japanese movements. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
difficult matter to authenticate or even to refer to. I have seen
Chinese official reports (translated ones) in which two cruisers
are specifically mentioned, but a Chinese official report is not
necessarily confirmation. There is no question whatever but that
the Chinese spread the rumour of British sympathy and benevolent
neutrality; it is fairly clear, too, that now and again they obtained
information as to Japanese whereabouts from British men-of-war. But
it is not proved that this was anything more than in the course of
ordinary conversation, and there is no reason whatever to believe that
the British Government had a hand in the matter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br> THE BATTLE OF YALU<br> (HAI YANG)</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japan,</span>
having been as good as presented with the command of the sea,
swiftly moved an army into Korea. This went on till, in September,
China began to realise that if she wished to hold that country she must
use the sea as transport. At Ping Yang her land forces had suffered
a severe defeat; reinforcements were urgently required. Ting was,
therefore, ordered to convey these to the Yalu River.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 1st, at 1 a.m., Ting sailed from Talien Bay,
having with him the Ting Yuen (flag), Chen Yuen, Lai Yuen, King Yuen,
Ping Yuen, battleships;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and the cruisers Chin Yuen, Chih Yuen, Tche Yuen, Tchao Yong, and Yank
Wei; two gunboats, Kuang Kai and Kuang Ping; four “flat-iron” Rendel
gunboats; four torpedo boats; and five transports, carrying a thousand
men each.</p>

<p>Reaching the mouth of the Yalu on the same evening, he sent the
transports, under convoy of the Ping Yuen, Kuang Ping, and torpedo
boats, up the Yalu River, anchoring twelve miles out with his main fleet.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Early next morning the smoke of the Japanese, burning Takashima coal,
was observed on the horizon.</p>

<p>It has never been clearly demonstrated whether the meeting was
accidental or designed. The balance of evidence, to my mind, is in
favour of the theory that Admiral Ito calculated that the Chinese
would, after Ping Yang, send ships to the mouth of the Yalu, conveying
troops. That certainly was Admiral Ito’s theory.</p>

<p>The Chinese lay with banked fires. On seeing the Japanese smoke, they
got up anchor, and adopted the prearranged battle-formation—line
abreast <i>en échelon</i>, the centre strong, the wings weak. Line
abreast was the best formation for the Chinese fleet, which was best
in bow fire, but the weak ends of the wings were a serious error. In
addition, the Yang Wei and Tcho Yong were slow at getting up anchor.</p>

<p>The Japanese came along in line ahead, the flying squadron leading the
main astern of it.</p>

<p>The rival squadrons were as follows:—</p>

<p>Japan: 8 cruisers, 1 old battleship, 1 old “belted cruiser,” 1 gunboat,
and 1 armed liner.</p>

<p>China: 4 battleships, 3 cruisers, 3 gunboats, with (coming from the
Yalu) 1 battleship, 1 gunboat, and 2 torpedo boats.</p>

<p>The Japanese fleet fought by signals throughout; the Chinese fought
without signals, on a prearranged plan. In <i>materiel</i>, so far
as ships went, the fleets were about on a par in fighting value.
Actually, the Japanese were superior—in part from the possession of
Q.F. guns, in part because the Chinese were very badly supplied with
shell. Had they had a good supply of shell, there is little question
but that, with their preponderance of large calibre guns, they would
have destroyed the Japanese fleet, especially as Admiral Ito made a
considerable error at the outset.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
The first shot, which fell short, was fired by the Ting Yuen at 12.30.
A moment later the battle was general.</p>

<p>The sea was smooth—almost glassy—the sky dull. There was, however, a
growing breeze, and this blew towards the Chinamen, so that the black
smoke from the Japanese cruisers acted as a helpful screen.</p>

<p>The Japanese came on, and passed right across the Chinese front,
turning in succession eight points to port, when they opened on the
Chinese at 3000 yards. This passing across the front was dangerous, and
the Chinese nearly succeeded in cutting the Japanese line. They lost
station in doing so, masking each other; and to this the Japanese fleet
owed much, and only their tail was endangered. The Fuso was badly hit.
The Hi Yei, in danger of being rammed, had to alter her course. She
passed between the Chinese battleships at short range, getting badly
hit as she cleared them. The Akagi was badly knocked about; the Saikio
alone passed on unhurt.</p>

<p>The Chinese had by now half won the battle, but they were in such a
muddle with their ships that the advantage was never followed up. At
this time the flying squadron, which had cut off the two old gunboats to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
starboard of the Chinese line, was masked by the remaining four vessels
of the main fleet; and an inspection of the plan of the second stage
will show how near victory was for the Chinamen had their fleet only
been in hand. Overwhelming heavy gunfire was theirs.</p>

<p>They lost the opportunity, however, and the flying squadron, after a
short engagement with the Ping Yuen division, circled and came round on
the Chinese front, while the main squadron, also turning, assailed its
rear. The Ping Yuen devoted herself to a fruitless attempt at chasing
the main Japanese fleet, while the bulk of the Chinese wasted effort in
an attempt to complete the destruction of the little Akagi. In doing
this they came under fire of the flying squadron, which sank both the
King Yuen and Chih Yuen with its 10.2-in. guns.</p>

<p>Attempts by one of the torpedo boats to sink the Saikio-maru failed;
she also survived a fire from the Chinese battleships. The Lai Yuen was
by now ablaze; the Ching Yuen was no better off. Both battleships were
also on fire. The pendulum had swung round, and everything pointed to a
complete victory for Japan.</p>

<p>Matters were thus when, at 3.30, the Matsushima was put out of action.
The incidents enabled the battleships to recover, and they took,
without much serious harm, a hammering from the entire Japanese fleet
that remained.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
This stage continued till nightfall, when the Chinese got into line and
steamed away, followed for a short distance only by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Both sides claimed the victory; as a matter of fact, it was a drawn
battle. When the length of time the battle took is considered, the
damages were relatively small. In detail, they were as follows:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Japanese Fleet’s Damages.</span></h3>

<p>The Japanese flagship, Matsushima, went through the battle without
any particular harm for a considerable while, when one of the
Chinese ironclads fired a 12-in. common shell at her, which hit her,
making a big hole. It went in and wiped out practically the entire
battery, disabled two or three guns completely, and exploded some
spare ammunition. Altogether 100 men were killed or wounded by that
one shell, and she had to be hauled out of action. When that 12-in.
shell hit, the majority of the men were in working dresses, in cotton
things and so on, and a great many of them were men with beards, and
a Japanese officer who was on board the ship at the time tells me
that every single one of these men with cotton dresses was set on
fire, and all the men with beards and long hair also had their beards
and hair set on fire, and were rushing all over the ship, whereas
several officers, who happened to be in serge uniform near by, were
comparatively little hurt. The ship was set on fire to a certain
extent, but a few buckets of water very easily put the fire out.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>This ship was also hit by a 10.2-in. shell a little earlier in the
action. It hit her torpedo-room, glanced up, and knocked up against the
barbette; but as the shell was loaded with cement its burst did not do
very much harm.</p>

<p>The second ship in the Japanese line was the Chiyoda. She was also hit
by a 12-in. shell, but that was another cement or coal-dust shell, so
did not burst. It went through just above the belt. Had it hit the belt
it ought to have sunk her; above, it simply made a large hole through
and went out again, and the ship was none the worse; there was not a
single man killed or wounded.</p>

<p>The Naniwa was hit by an 8.2-in. on the water-line, which went into
the coal bunkers, but it did no particular harm there. The shell was
afterwards picked up and pieced together, and a photograph taken of
such sections as were got. Twenty-seven pieces were recovered, and they
say there must have been a great many more. But that 8.2-in. shell
practically did no harm whatever to the ship. The coal bunkers acted
very efficiently.</p>

<p>In the Itsukushima there were shells in the torpedo-room, but none of
the torpedoes exploded—if there were any there with war-heads, which
is rather uncertain. There was also a shell in the engine-room, which,
curiously enough, did no harm.</p>

<p>The Hashidate had a 6-in. shell burst right up against the barbette of
a big gun, which was not hurt at all by it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span></p>

    <p class="f120 spb1"><b>BATTLE OF YALU:<br> <span class="fs_80">THIRD STAGE.</span></b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
The Hi Yei, an oldish ship, was raked by a 12-in. common shell, and
also by some smaller shells, which set her on fire and practically blew
the ship to pieces.</p>

<p>The Sakio-maru was quite a small vessel. She was hit first of all
by a 12-in. common shell, which, in theory, ought to have blown her
to atoms. It disabled her steering-gear and wounded one man. She
altogether got eleven hits from pieces of 4.7-in. or over. Of these,
four were 12-in. shell, of which two burst inside; and the net result
of those eleven hits was to wound eleven men, to kill nobody, but to
make the ship leak a bit. The torpedoes fired at her missed, as has
already been stated. The reason was that the boat fired as she turned,
and the torpedo went under. Two others fired at longer ranges missed
badly. The torpedo boat was not hit. The Chinese version of the affair
runs to the effect that the Japanese on board the Saikio deserted their
guns in panic at the attack. This statement rests, of course, only on
the Chinese assertion.</p>

<p>The Akagi was hit by a 12-in. common shell, which struck the mainmast
and sent it overboard, and killed the captain. The peculiar thing
about it was that all the hits took her about that part; there was
not a single hit forward, but the bridge, which stands somewhere aft,
was continually swept, and the second in command was wounded almost
immediately after he went on the bridge. The third officer, Lieut.
Sato, then went up, and was hit by a fragment of shell that scraped the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
top of his head off, and he went down below. A fourth man went up; he
got wounded, and the third man went up again and carried on. She was
able to steam and go home quite comfortably after the battle.</p>

<p>A gun shield, about two inches thick, was struck, and the shell that
hit it is supposed to have been a 6-in. common. It simply scooped out
the shield about an inch or so, and did no harm to the men inside, who
were just round the corner, and did no harm whatever to the gun.</p>

<p>One shell burst on the upper deck, wrecked everything, made a
tremendous mess, and riddled the deck all over, but the harm was
practically <i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>The old battleship Fuso was hit more than any other Japanese ship, but
every hit upon her has been kept confidential. Still, so far as can be
guessed, the Japanese opinion of the result of the fire on this ship
was that armour under the peculiar circumstances of the Yalu tended to
aggravate hits rather than the reverse, and it is certainly interesting
that this ship, with an armoured battery, completely armoured belt, and
fairly thick armour which could not be penetrated by any of the Chinese
6-in. shell, should have been one of the most damaged ship of any.

<h3><span class="smcap">Chinese Fleet’s Damages.</span></h3>

<p>The Chinese flagship was an ironclad of 7000 tons displacement, the
Ting Yuen. The first thing that hit her was a big ricochet which flew
up and knocked the mast, carried it over the side, and killed all the
men in the fighting-top. She was peppered all over by the Japanese, and
hit something like 300 times, the result of the 300 hits being 14 men
killed and 25 wounded. She was set on fire practically continuously all
through the action. As soon as one fire was put out she was set on fire
again in another place; but the Chinese managed to get these fires out
without any bother, and no harm was done to her that way.</p>

<p>The second principal Chinese ship was the Chen Yuen. She was hit 400
times. The photograph of her in dock is how she appeared shortly after
the battle. The funnel was peppered over everywhere. All the men in
the fighting-tops were killed. The fore 6-in. turret was hit; it is
only about an inch thick, and this shell went through and killed or
wounded the gun’s crew, but did not hurt the gun. The only gun that was
disabled at all in the battle was one of the 12-in., and it appears to
have been disabled by something very big—probably one of the Japanese
12.6-in. shell hit the barbette of the ship, and the concussion upset
the training gear of the guns in some way. Nothing could be done with
them for about ten minutes. After that they were got in working order
and fired again: This ship was also set on fire all over the place, but
was perfectly able to fight when the battle was over.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>The Chen Yuen had on board her the famous Captain McGiffin, who wrote a
great deal about his adventures in the fight. He was an American, who
was usually described as commander of the ship and as having fought the
battle. He was photographed against the hits in a desperately wounded
condition, but afterwards it was surmised that he was not blind to
dramatic effect. His narratives can hardly be accepted as historical
evidence, save in a general way.</p>

<p>The next ship of interest at the battle of Yalu was the Elswick
cruiser, Chih Yuen. She is described in most accounts of the Yalu as
having very gallantly charged the entire Japanese fleet, attempting
to ram; a tremendous fire was poured into her till she went down, and
there was an end of her. According to Japanese officers, what really
happened was that at an early stage in the action her steering-gear got
disabled; she was simply wandering about unable to do anything. She was
simply a cloud of white smoke drifting along. The Takachiho, one of the
Japanese cruisers, had a 10-in. gun. She waited until the Chih Yuen was
within something like 400 yards, when they could not miss, then let
drive with this 10-in. They did not attempt to pick out any particular
part of the Chih Yuen; they simply fired “into the brown.” They hit her
somewhere rather high up near the funnel; there was a tremendous cloud
of white smoke, which became red, and when that cloud went the ship was
gone. There is no idea that any magazine was hit, or that there was any
ammunition on deck to account for it, and the favourite theory of the
Japanese officers is that this particular hit upset her stability in
some way and did the finishing touch, and thus caused her to capsize.

Opposite is a sketch by a Japanese officer of the sinking of the King
Yuen, which was a small Chinese ironclad. There is a great deal of
mystery in all the histories as to how that ship really did go down.
The Japanese account of it is that “she was on fire, and apparently the
fire could not be put out; she began to roll very much indeed—first
very heavily over one way and then very heavily over the other way; she
continued rolling like that, and one time she rolled and did not come
back.”</p>

<p>She had a sister ship, the Lai Yuen. This ship was set on fire at an
early stage of the action, and the Chinese apparently did not trouble
to put the fire out. The consequence was it got a large hold and burnt
every scrap of woodwork in the ship. But the extraordinary thing is
that her people managed to go on fighting. Of her deck nothing was left
but twisted beams. The ship was nearly white-hot, and a number of men
got roasted to death in her; but she was still in fighting condition when
the battle ended. Probably only Chinamen could have fought in such conditions.</p>

<p>The Ching Yuen was set on fire, but not badly hit in any way.</p>

<p>There were two other Chinese ships lost, the Tchao Yung and the Yang
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
Wei. These were set on fire at a very early stage, and most of the
accounts that we hear of the danger of fire in action are based upon
these two particular ships. It appears that their captains were
economical men, who liked to make a little money; so when the ships
were painted they did not scrape off the old paint, and as the ships
were about twelve years old the paint got very thick. Moreover, as they
found kerosine cheaper than linseed oil, they mixed the paint always
with kerosine. The ships, therefore, were of a somewhat inflammable
nature. When they got hit, the men trying to put the fire out got hit
also, and the ships were then simply left to blaze away. That is the
true cause of most of the fire scares that happened just after Yalu.</p>

<p>The Chinese shell were very defective indeed. They had very few shell
with any charges; nearly all they had to fire with were solid shot or
cement shell, the very worst possible thing for firing at cruisers
with; and this fact that they had no good shell must, perhaps, account
for the survival of the Japanese fleet. For although just after Yalu
the Japanese said that their shooting was 15 per cent. and the Chinese
10 per cent., they have since stated that the Chinese hits were
something like 25 per cent. and their own about 12 per cent., and they
say that in the early stages of the battle the Chinese never missed a
single shot with their big guns—they hit every ship that they fired
at; and they describe them as being some of the best gunners in the
world—that these No. 1 Chinese gunners were born shots; but gradually,
as the battle went on, the Japanese 3-pounders and machine guns playing
on the Chinese ships took off the heads of those men, and they were
replaced by other men who were not such good shots, and this went on
until, towards the end of the battle, practically no hitting at all was
done by the Chinese. But in the early part of the fight their shooting
was very good indeed.

    <p class="f120 spb1"><b>BATTLE OF YALU:<br> <span class="fs_80">FOURTH STAGE.</span></b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
The Japanese in their fleet had three enormous guns, each of 66 tons,
which would penetrate something like double the thickness of any
armour opposed to them. Only one of those guns seems to have been in
a condition to fire. In the excitement of the battle the Japanese got
something wrong with the gear, and had to manipulate them by hand;
and the consequence was that two of those guns fired about once each,
and the third once an hour. It is unfortunate that these guns did not
secure at least one fair and square hit—the data of it would have been
extremely valuable.</p>

<p>After the battle of Yalu the Chinese ships were patched up. The Tche
Yuen, which had already taken part in the battle of Asan, took part in
Yalu, but was then knocked about and ran away. Although she had been
so badly hit in the battle of Asan, when she was doing the strategical
movement at the rear, she only took eight days to patch up, and she was
then able to go out to sea again. After Yalu she was very quickly got
ready once more.</p>

<p>The first conclusion one is forced to is that penetration does not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
to have done anything in this battle. Where a gun was matched against
some very inferior armour, it went through and smashed it up, but
wherever the armour that it ought to penetrate was anything like equal
to the gun, the result was failure.</p>

<p>The second point is the astonishing amount of hitting that all these
ships seem to have been able to stand. There are many cases of quite
little ships that in theory one single shell would finish, but it has
taken five or six shells to disable them at all, and in a week or two
they have been fit to go out fighting again. The Saikio-maru, and the
way she was hammered and still managed to go on fighting and remain in
a fairly good condition, is a particular case in point. Although the
upper works may be knocked about and splintered, and so on, it does not
seem much good splintering the upper works and making a mess of the
ship unless there is a gun near it, and somebody to be disabled. Now,
this conclusion is dead against the “moral effect” theory. It is almost
a gospel that if the upper works are shelled enough the crew somewhere
else will get demoralised. I do not believe it; they will not in a
modern war be aware of it. I think this point should be laid to heart
and thought over by those who have 6-in. guns to attack ships with. To
do harm, they must fire those guns with all the intelligence they can
bring to bear.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is well to remember, as in the case of the King
Yuen and Chih Yuen, that hits in the upper works caused the loss of
these ships by affecting stability, so far as can be gathered in the
absence of the hulls now at the bottom of the Yellow Sea.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
A third point is, that the danger from fire in action is grossly
exaggerated. As to the Japanese, they one and all say that they had
no trouble with fire at Yalu. They have not entirely done away with
woodwork in their ships. Following the fashion set by the Germans,
they have done away with a fair amount, but their ships are by no
means without wood, like German ships and others which have not been
in action—though even Germans are now reverting to a certain amount
of wood. The Japanese say that they had buckets of water standing
round; the men ran to the buckets of water, and the fire was under.
The Chinese had exactly the same system, and they had no trouble till
about the end of the action, when they got demoralised, and then
the fire began to get headway. Hose pipes seem to have always been
untrustworthy, too liable to be holed by splinters. Wet sand proved
excellent. It may be noted that hits on the sea near the ships deluged
all the exposed parts of ships at Yalu with water. The loss of life was
returned as follows:—</p>

<p>During the battle both the Tche Yuen and Kuang Chi ran away. The first

reached Port Arthur, and her captain was beheaded; the other ran ashore
at Talienwan, and remained there till she was found on the 23rd by the
Naniwa and Akitsushima, which destroyed her. The Yang Wei was finished
by a spar torpedo on the 18th.</p>

<p>The remaining Chinese ships reached Port Arthur without adventure, and
“victory” was celebrated by the draping of all guns, save those of the
Tche Yuen, in red. They refitted very slowly.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Japanese, on the other hand, kept the sea, repairing ships—except
the Matsushima—in secluded bays. The least damaged cruisers watched
Port Arthur and Wei-hai-wei.</p>

<p>On October 20th the Chinese were all repaired, and went to Wei-hai-wei,
whence Admiral Ting meanwhile cruised aimlessly; but no action took
place, and on November 7th he returned to Wei-hai-wei. Here the Chen
Yuen ran ashore while entering harbour, and did not get off for three
weeks. She was not repaired till the middle of January, a great hole in
her bottom having to be mended. This was done with cement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Japanese, ignoring Ting, concentrated efforts on Port
Arthur, the Lao Tung Peninsula being invaded while the Japanese fleet
lay blockading the enemy in Wei-hai-wei. On the 20th he returned to
Port Arthur, leaving a few cruisers to watch Ting, and the rest of the
fleet took part in the fighting there.

<p>On the 21st the fleet steamed past the harbour entrance, about seven
miles out. They then detached the Chiyoda, which went to Pigeon Bay,
and shelled Port Arthur at extreme range till 4 p.m.</p>

<p>At that time the Chinese fired at the fleet without result, till a
heavy squall came on, in the midst of which the torpedo boats rushed
the harbour. Excellently manœuvred, they got in untouched, and shelled
the disorganised Chinese in the town. Outside, the Japanese soldiers
were carrying fort after fort, the defence being poor, as the Chinese
grew panic-stricken.

flooded the world for the next few days. It has been strenuously
denied that any massacre took place, but this is not correct. Few, if
any, civilians were killed; there were next to none in the place, the
supposed dead civilians being Chinese soldiers, who had discarded the
overcoats, which were the only uniform they had, in order to continue
the fight on guerilla lines. But very little quarter was given.</p>

<p>A Japanese disavowal and explanation will be found below:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author">To the Editor of the <i>Japan Mail</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In September last, for the purpose
of studying the practical application of International Law, I joined
the fleet, and embarked in a man-of-war of the Imperial Japanese
Navy. I am now staying in Port Arthur, after witnessing several
battles. Being a subscriber to your paper, I saw in the issue of the
21st January some singular statements by Mr. Creelman, to which you
refer. It being impossible for an eye-witness like me to pass over
such a matter in silence, I enclose an explanation of this affair, in
the hope that you will kindly have it translated at your office, and
published through the columns of your valuable paper. What I write
is an accurate and faithful description of the things that actually
happened, and I vouch for their truth in the sight of Heaven. Convinced
that the contents of my letter are of value to the public at large,
I venture to trouble you, especially since my facts may furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
material to strengthen the position you take in the matter. Harassed by
official business of various kinds, I cannot find leisure to write at
greater length, and must crave your kind indulgence.</p>

<p class="author">I am, sir, your obedient servant,<br>
<span class="smcap">Takahashi Sakuye</span>,<br><i>Hogakushi</i>,</p>

<p>Professor at the Naval University, and Ex-legal Adviser to
the Commander-in-Chief of the Regular Imperial Fleet.</p>

<p class="center spa1"><span class="smcap">Enclosure.</span></p>

<p>On the occasion of the battle of Port Arthur I was on board the
Itsukushima, and accurately observed the fight as carried on both
on shore and at sea. I saw how the Imperial troops fought, and how
the squadron co-operated with the army off the coast of Port Arthur,
and I watched the movements of the enemy with the utmost vigilance.
Similarly, I carefully looked out for any incident that might furnish
material for the study of my special subject, and I do not therefore
hesitate to say that I am among those best informed as to what actually
took place on that occasion. Equally, I do not hesitate to declare that
I saw nothing blameworthy about the assault on Port Arthur.</p>

<p>I have seen to-day in a copy of the <i>Japan Mail</i> that reached
me, that Mr. Creelman, the war correspondent of the <i>New York
World</i>, wrote to that paper to the following effect: “Torpedo boats
were going through the waves, sinking junks loaded with men, women, and
children endeavouring to escape. Ten junks, laden with terror-stricken
people, were thus sunk, and the water was filled with drowning
inhabitants.” While regretting, for the sake of Mr. Creelman, whose
honour as a gentleman may be impaired by such absurd fabrications, I
fear that the public might be led astray by what he has written, and
therefore I feel constrained to refute the false statements made by him.</p>

<p>In the first place, the assertions of Mr. Creelman are entirely
imaginary; for his allegation that he saw from the shore, on the day of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
the assault upon Port Arthur, that is, on November 21, 1894, Japanese
men-of-war and torpedo boats in motion, cannot be founded on actual
fact. It is true that on the 21st men-of-war and torpedo boats were off
the coast of Port Arthur, but for two days, from the evening of the
21st, they were away from the coast, owing to stress of weather. Now,
Port Arthur was not entirely taken on the 21st. Severe struggles were
still in progress on that day. Hence it was practically impossible at
such a juncture to see the warships and torpedo boats in motion off
the coast of Port Arthur, and the fictitiousness of any statement to
the contrary will be admitted by any one actually at the scene of the
battle. On that same day certain staff officers of the Army, desiring
to communicate some intelligence to the fleet, could only effect their
object by braving extraordinary dangers and hardships, and by passing
through the lines of the enemy. How, then, could Mr. Creelman have seen
the movements of the fleet and the torpedo flotilla except in pure
imagination!</p>

<p>Secondly, while the fleet and flotilla were lying off the coast
of Port Arthur and in the vicinity, from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. on the
21st, not a single Chinese junk was captured. Only two junks escaped
that day, at a little past 5 p.m. But the commander of the fleet had
specially ordered that any small vessel of the kind should be let
alone, attention being paid to the larger only. No other junk escaped.
It is true that there were five or six junks on the shore, close by the
foot of Lao-Tie-Shan, but they were all beached. Thus the statement
that junks, loaded with men, women, and children, were sunk is not only
absolutely groundless, but the very allegation that such a number of
junks attempted to escape is a fabrication.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is a fact that at a little past 4 p.m. two steamers
emerged from Port Arthur. It was subsequently known by the confession
of Chinese prisoners that a number of Chinese officers were on these
vessels. It is also a fact that torpedo boats pursued these steamers.
It would have been a neglect of duty on the part of the fleet to
disregard the escape of such vessels. When the torpedo boats gave chase
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
to the steamers, they signalled, “Heave-to, or take the consequence.”
The steamers not obeying, two blank cartridges were fired after them,
but they still kept on their course. Moreover, they returned the fire
of their pursuers, and the latter therefore began to chase them with
more vigour. Thereat one of the steamers turned back into the harbour,
and the other changing its course, ran ashore, and all the persons on
board fled. Was not this procedure on the part of the Japanese officers
perfectly proper, and in strict accordance with the canons of western nations?</p>

<p>The foregoing explanations are sufficient to prove the falsehood of
Mr. Creelman’s statements. I regret that he should be so lost to the
sense of honour as to fabricate such injurious stories. In order that
the public may not be deceived, I beg you to give publicity to these
facts.</p>

</div>

<p>This disposes of the most gruesome fictions about the massacre, but it
does not deal with what took place on shore.</p>

<p>The true story, as I had it from a Japanese army officer who was there,
is as follows:—</p>

<p>The battle was over, and the Japanese were marching into the town, a
few Chinese retreating before them. Isolated fighting continued; but
the place was, to all intents and purposes, captured.</p>

<p>As the victorious Japanese pressed forward, a young officer suddenly
came across the remains of his brother, who had been captured, wounded,
a day or two before. The body showed that death had been inflicted with
atrocious Chinese tortures.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>Maddened at this dreadful sight, the young officer practically ran
amok. Crying “No quarter,” he began to kill. His men, understanding
the cause, started on the same career of vengeance; and it spread like
wildfire through the army, that the town was full of the corpses of
tortured Japanese prisoners, and two or three regiments got out of
hand. For some time “Vengeance” was the battle-cry, and terrible things
happened that night.</p>

<p>Before we blame the Japanese, we should remember that our own hands are
not quite clean in this matter; human nature has its limitations, and
there are many men still living who can recall what they did when, in
the Indian Mutiny, they found rebels red-handed among the tortured and
outraged bodies of British ladies and children. Armchair ethics may
condemn; but the armchair critics sit at home doing the condemnation.
It is less easy to be philosophical in the hour of battle. The
philosopher must have been through it, and abstained from slaughter,
for his strictures to be worth anything. Personally, I think few things
come more under the head of “excusable” than the Port Arthur massacre,
so long as human nature remains human.</p>

<p>Port Arthur was converted into a Japanese base, and for a few weeks
events languished, while preparations were made for the attack on
Wei-hai-wei.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br> WEI-HAI-WEI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span>
January 18, 1895, the Japanese fleet bombarded Teng-ckow-foo, facing
Port Arthur on the Chinese mainland. It is about eight miles west of
Wei-hai-wei.</p>

<p>On the 19th the bombardment was continued; on the 20th the army was
landed to the east of Wei-hai-wei.</p>

<p>Wei-hai-wei was moderately fortified, chiefly with 8-in. Krupp guns.
There were a few larger ones, and a sprinkling of modern pieces.
Mostly, however, the guns were old. On Leu-Kun tau<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
were some more forts, a gunnery school, and a coaling station. The
Chinese fleet lay behind this island, the Japanese watching both
entrances, which were protected by booms.</p>

<p>On the 30th the Japanese fleet and army opened fire on the defences.
In this affair the Chao-pei-tsui defences were silenced by the Naniwa,
Akitsushima, and Katsuragi, the division being under command of Captain
(now Admiral) Togo. The magazine was exploded, and the forts taken
possession of by the Japanese soldiers. Before retreating, however, the
Chinese destroyed all save a few old guns.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
The rest of the fleet bombarded Leu-Kun tau without much result
on either side. The Chinese warships took part in the defence. A
photograph of this battle, taken from a captured fort, is given.</p>

<p>The net result, however, of the operations of the 30th to 31st was that
the Japanese took practically everything except the island. On the
night of the 31st, Admiral Ito decided on a torpedo-boat attack. Both
entrances had some boom defence, with gaps here and there. The Japanese
attempted to attack by the east with sixteen boats.</p>

<p>The Japanese soldiers in the forts took them for Chinese, so they
retired.</p>

<p>A heavy gale came on next day, and the whole Japanese fleet ran
to shelter at Teng-chow, returning on February 2nd, when another
ineffectual bombardment at 2500 metres took place. An equally
ineffective torpedo attack was tried in the night. It failed, as the
Chinese sighted the boats, and they wisely did not try to force their
way in.</p>

<p>Next day, and the next again, the bombardment was violently renewed,
but on both sides it led to nothing save expenditure of ammunition.
Landings on Leu-Kun tau led to nothing, and the only incident of real
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
moment was the rushing out of twelve Chinese torpedo boats on the 4th.</p>

<p>Several were sunk as they came out; the rest ran ashore, and were
captured or destroyed. So far as can be gathered, Ting had found his
boats a nuisance, and was in terror of the Japanese boats being allowed
in in mistake for Chinese ones. He also appears to have imagined that a
daylight attack might produce something in his favour; but the balance
of evidence seems to point to the fact that the boats were a nuisance
to him.</p>

<p>Whatever was intended, the Chinese boats made no attack on the Japanese
cruisers; escape was their only objective. Only two succeeded in
getting away.</p>

<p>On the night of the 4th the third torpedo attack was made. The boats
went in in three divisions of four each, though only the second and
third divisions went in—the first being employed to create a diversion
at the western entrance.</p>

<p>The eastern boats crept in slowly, in a cold so intense that an officer
and two men were frozen to death. Two boats (8 and 21), their steersmen
frost-bitten, grounded as they tried to enter.</p>

<p>By four o’clock a boat had got quite near the Chinese, and fired two
torpedoes without result; a second boat was no luckier with three.
Not till then did the Chinese open fire, and this boat ran ashore
immediately afterwards.

Two more boats collided in the confusion, another had her boilers
burst, yet another was badly hit. Only one boat came out unscathed. As
mentioned further on in “Personal Characteristics,” the real truth of
the attack has never been known, and never will be, save vaguely.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Its result, however, is well known, the battleship Ting Yuen was hit in
the stern and sank in the mud, where she lay with her upper works above
water and guns still firing.</p>

<p>Throughout the 5th the bombardment continued unabated, and though no
harm was done, the ceaseless worry told heavily on the Chinese.</p>

<p>On the night of the 5th a fourth attack was made by the first division.
It met with little resistance, torpedoed the Lai Yuen and a despatch
vessel, the Wei Yuen, and also hit the Ching Yuen in the bow without
sinking her. The boats met with no defence worth mentioning; the
Chinese look-outs, worn out with the ceaseless bombardments, were
mostly asleep.</p>

<p>On the 6th a landing was effected on Leu-Kun tau, and on the 7th the
usual bombardment continued. The Matsushima, Naniwa, and Yoshino were
hit, but the Chinese lost a magazine, blown up.</p>

<p>On the 9th the Ching Yuen sank, her end being accelerated by a
water-line hit from a shore gun. The Itsukushima was hit on the
water-line this day by a shell from the 12-in. guns of the Chen Yuen,
but the shell failed to burst. On the 10th and 11th the bombardment
still continued. Only one fort now remained to the Chinese, but their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
ships still afloat were comparatively little hurt. The moral effect of
the continuous firing finally broke them down, and on the 12th, in the
midst of the firing, a gunboat flying a white flag came out.</p>

<p>The Japanese ceased fire, and the gunboat came to the Matsushima. Two
officers from the Chinese fleet came on board, and delivered a letter
from Admiral Ting to Admiral Ito, suggesting terms of surrender. It
is worthy of note that, so one of the Malsushima’s officers told me,
these two Chinamen, on being taken to the wardroom to await Admiral
Ito’s reply, promptly and instantly fell asleep, and were only awakened
later with the greatest difficulty. They were absolutely worn out. It
is stated, also, that the whole of the beleaguered crews did the same
thing directly firing ceased; want of sleep was, indeed, the immediate
cause of Admiral Ting’s surrender, though, of course, his position was
absolutely hopeless.</p>

<p>Ting surrendered on condition that the lives of his men were spared,
but he and his principal officers committed suicide. The whole of
the defenders were executed by the Chinese at the first available
opportunity.</p>

<p>Japanese naval losses during this affair were officially given as:—</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub3">2 officers and 27 men killed.</li>
<li class="isub3">4     ”     &emsp;”  &emsp;32  ”  wounded.</li>
</ul>

<p>On shore the army lost much more heavily, as during the fighting the
entire force occupying one captured fort were destroyed by the Chen
Yuen, which steamed up close to them and opened fire.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
Chinese losses were never stated, but they are believed to have been
much less than was expected. The entire crews of the Lai Yuen and Wei
Yuen were lost, and most of those in the Ching Yuen.</p>

<p>Wei-hai-wei was won chiefly through sheer human inability to stand
the strain of the everlasting bombardment and torpedo menace. Guns
accomplished practically nothing directly towards it, and even the
torpedo <i>per se</i> was not decisive. The principal factor was
Admiral Ito’s persistent and unremitting attack.</p>

<p>With Wei-hai-wei the war was practically over. The only remaining
incident of note was an attack on Formosa, in which, if all accounts
are true, the Japanese did not shine very greatly, or else there are
problems in war which in peace cannot be conceived. It is stated that
the Japanese began to bombard at 8 a.m. The Chinese had loaded all
guns; they left a few men to fire them, and then retired. Reply ceased
about 8.30, but the Japanese did not, it is said, discover it till
about 2 p.m. An explanation, of course, is that they did not trust the
silence of the forts—which is reasonable enough. That they did not
notice it is the accusation of their critics.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Save</span>
for a few torpedo boats lost, the war left the Japanese fleet
unimpaired; the ships damaged at Yalu were in trim again when peace was
declared. On the other hand, beyond the Chin Yen, Japan gained little
in the ships she took. The Tche Yuen is of very small fighting value,
the Ping Yuen of none, and none of the gunboats are of any utility. Of
the captured torpedo boats, one was superior to any Japanese boat; the
rest, from long neglect, were in a bad way.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the war the Esmeralda (now Idzumi), already
described, passed from the Chilian to the Japanese Navy, and at its
close the Tatsuta, detained <i>en route</i>, proceeded on her way.</p>

<p>Just before war broke out—in May, 1894—the Akaski, a sister to the
Suma, had been laid down at Yokosuka; the two battleships Fuji and
Yashima, of an improved Royal Sovereign type, were progressing in
England, the former at the Thames Ironworks, the latter at Elswick.

The Suma was launched at Yokosuka on March 9, 1895. Unlike the
Akitsushima and other ships which had preceded her, she is of entirely
Japanese design and workmanship, and nothing more Western than an odd
“stand-by man” or two assisted in her construction. Practically, she is
the first Japanese-built ship. Particulars of her are:—</p>

These ships are, as has been before noted, improved Royal Sovereigns.
As designed, they would have differed from these ships only in that,
being some 1500 tons smaller, they are able to carry less weight
in the way of coal, etc. Their big guns, 12 in. against 13.5 in.,
are lighter, but against this must be put the fact that they carry
heavy shields to them. Further, the introduction of Harvey steel
in the place of compound armour greatly increased the value of
their armour without adding to its weight. Regarded in the light
of present-day developments, they are defective in protection to
the secondary armament nearly as much as the Royal Sovereigns were
before reconstruction. A comparison of the two ships, Fuji and Royal
Sovereign, is of interest.</p>

<p>The difference in armour value, caused by the introduction of Harvey
process in time to allow of its adoption on the Fuji, is very marked.
Since then, of course, Harvey has given place to Harvey nickel, and
this in its turn to Krupp process armour, of which 9 ins. would nearly
equal 17 ins. of Royal Sovereign armour. But their fine 12-in. guns, as
powerful still as any afloat, keep the Fuji class still in the ranks of
good fighting ships.

In appearance the two ships are almost identical, the only difference
being in the arrangement of the ventilators.</p>

<p>Between them, however, an important difference exists; the Yashima has
her dead wood cut away aft, while the Fugi has not. Consequently, the
Yashima is much the handier vessel, but, in part from the fact that
she was the first ship to have the dead wood aft cut away, in part
from inherent weaknesses thereby engendered, the Fuji is regarded as
the better ship of the two. The Yashima, being docked without proper
precautions suitable to the case, exhibited some dropping aft, in
consequence of the effect of the unsupported weight. This led to such
sterns being countermanded for subsequent Japanese battleships, though
in cruisers it is always applied. The turning circle of the Yoshima, it
may be mentioned, is extremely small.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be noted that these two ships were the first to be
fitted with the Elswick submerged torpedo tube. They have the earliest
pattern, and it will not deliver torpedoes very successfully when the
ship is at high speed.</p>

<p>Little differences in rig have been purposely introduced;
thus the Hatsuse is shorter-masted than the
Shikishima, and the Asahi and Mikasa have their funnels
differently placed, those of the latter being more amidships.</p>

<p>Also, instead of casemates, the Mikasa has her 6-in. battery protected
by a continuous armoured wall. Essentially, however, the ships are
sisters.</p>

<p>Although she differs considerably from the Shikishima in appearance,
the Asahi is practically a sister ship, the sole points of difference
being (1) funnels; (2) distribution of the 2½-pounders; (3) absence of
a bow torpedo boat; and (4) mounting of the big guns. There are, of
course, certain minor structural differences—such, for instance, as
the fact that the Asahi has a slightly larger wardroom, and that this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
wardroom is a trifle further aft—but, generally speaking, for fighting
purposes they are identical, save for the points of difference noted
above. There are unseen differences of detail also, such as the
thickness of the armour deck, but none of these affect the fighting
value. There is a difference, too, in the coal carried, but coal
capacity does not show to the eye.</p>

There is some doubt about the Asahi’s coal, 1400 tons may be the
maximum and 700 the normal. Japanese ships do not need to carry much
coal, being designed to operate in waters where friendly coal stations
are numerous. True, ships thus kept short are likely to be out of
action because they are coaling, about once a week; but, on the other
hand, as they get two extra 6-in. quickfirers and four 12-pounders for
this sacrifice, they are rather envied by our naval officers. After
all, the primary duty of a battleship is to hit the enemy hard, and
an extra 6-in. in the broadside is no mean advantage. There are other
incidental advantages too—a single 6-in. shell would put all the
eight 12-pounders out of action on the upper deck of the Formidable,
while, thanks to the casemates acting as screens, the Asahi could only
lose four of her 3-in. by a single shell. In the placing of her 3-in.
guns she is altogether better off than the Formidable, the sole point
in which the British ship is superior being the four guns carried
on the main deck forward. The Formidable can fight all these on the
broadsides; it is doubtful if the Asahi could, because of the blast
from the big guns firing above them. But <i>per contra</i> she has her
other 3-in. quickfirers much better placed; they are more distributed.</p>

<p>The positions of these are: four on the main deck forward; four on
the main deck aft; four on the upper deck amidships; two on top of
the forward upper deck casemates; two beside the fore conning-tower;
and four beside the after conning-tower—a total of twenty. Those of
the Shikishima are placed in exactly the same fashion. Those of the
Formidable are: four on main deck forward (extreme bow); four on main
deck aft; and eight on upper deck amidships; a total of sixteen. Three
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
units instead of six; or, to put it another way, work for only three
shells instead of six shells.</p>

<p>The Asahi is an improvement on the Shikishima in the matter of the
2½-pounders—a very small detail. In the Shikishima these are grouped
on top of the amidship upper-deck casemates; in the Asahi only two are
over these casemates, the other four being distributed, a couple on
each bridge. Two theories are at work here, and it will need a war to
say which is the better. In the Shikishima it is easy to concentrate
three 2½-pounders on a single torpedo boat or portion of a big enemy,
while, as a price for this, they are at the mercy of a single shell.
Those of the Asahi are not thus at the mercy of one shell, but it will
be far less easy to concentrate them.</p>

<p>The next point of difference between the Shikishima and the Asahi is
that the former carries a bow above-water torpedo tube, with 6-in.
Harvey nickel protection to it. This tube, similarly protected, is in
the Fuji, Yashima, Asama, Tokiwa, and Yakumo. After some experiments
and practice the Japanese authorities decided that this tube was of no
use practically, and decreed its abolition. That of the Shikishima had,
however, already been built in, so this ship has it. In the Asahi the
design was modified, and the bow tube dropped out. It is absent also in
the Hatsuse, a sister, and in the Iwate and Idzumo.</p>

<p>Under certain circumstances such a tube might be of great use in
action—for instance, approaching an enemy who presented his broadside
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
while the ship possessing the tube wished to make a feint to close. But
to use it it would be necessary to slow down or reverse engines—both
things that might be awkward to do in an action. Still, the real
objection does not lie there, so much as in the trouble with sea that
a bow tube causes. Bow guns, even high up, are always liable to get
“washed out,” a bow torpedo tube is still more likely to be so. In
addition to this, it raises an unnecessary large bow wave.</p>

<p>In comparison with the Formidable, the Asahi and Shikishima
have—beside the 6-in. and 3-in. guns—other points of distinct
difference. They have (1) complete instead of partial belts; (2) 6-in.
instead of 9-in. armour protecting the lower deck; (3) much higher
barbettes; and (4) quite differently shaped hoods to the big guns.</p>

<p>Of these differences the armour one is of no immediate moment at
present. The Asahi, in the matter of armour, is practically a Majestic
with 3-in. stripped off the lower deck amidships and disposed on the
ends plus some extra armour paid for in the weight of coal carried.
Now, the 6-in. lower deck armour of the Asahi is proof against any
6-in. projectile at any range, and though a steel-pointed 9.2-in.
common shell has been through 6-in. Harvey nickel at Whale Island,
this is probably an isolated proving-ground case, and nothing but an
armour-piercing shell of large calibre is ever likely to get through
such armour in actual warfare. Also it is at least doubtful whether
such a shell would do more harm than a solid shot, and against a 12-in.
solid shot 9-in. armour is no more protection than 6-in. In either
case the shot will go through and dance about inside, and it is this
“dancing about” that makes shot dangerous, and all armour save the very
best a snare and a delusion so far as solid projectiles are concerned.
However, medium armour is imperatively needed to keep off shells,
for it is good-bye to any ship inside of which a big common shell is
comfortably planted. The Admiral class, for instance, would do no more
fighting once a big common shell got them amidships.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="f110 spb1"><b>MIKASA.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
As for the complete belt, the Formidable, of course, has something
on the bow, and this may be considered proof against 6-in. shell in
action, save at short range. It is, at any rate, proof against the
deadly little shell from 12-pounders and the like. As for any 6-in.
shot—well, very few 6-in. shot are carried in any ship, and holes made
by them are easily plugged.</p>

<p>The real gain of the Asahi is the extra gun-power, but since it is held
essential that British ships shall have a large coal supply, it is
useless to decry the Formidable over the two missing 6-in. guns. The
defect of the Formidable, and one that might have been remedied, is the
position of the 12-pounders. These could and should have been either
more distributed, or else placed right up above everything and clear of
everything, much as the French place their 4-in. quickfirers. Such a
gun is extremely unlikely to be actually hit, whereas if it is crowded
about with bulwarks, boats, and so on, a shell coming anywhere near is
bound to burst with devastating effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>In appearance it is difficult to tell the Asahi from our Canopus class,
save for colour. A critical eye could detect the much higher barbettes
of the Japanese vessel and their different shape, but that is about
all, for the extra casemate would hardly be visible at any appreciable
distance. Like the Canopus class, the Asahi has the huge after funnel,
and the resemblance is increased by the tautness of her masts. The sign
manual of a British man-of-war is the rake forward of the top masts, in
the smartest Channel Fleet ships this is most noticeable; but the Asahi
also is taut.</p>

<p>The Asahi has a slight sheer forward, like all our new ships, in
consequence of which, though both pairs of guns are at the same height
above the water, the after barbette looks a good deal higher than the
fore one. The shields are peculiar. The plan gives a general idea
of their appearance—sloping fronts but straight sides. The British
pattern slopes all round, and is generally more squat—and of the two
is more favourably regarded afloat. If by any off chance a big shot hit
the side of the Asahi shield it would get through, from the inclined
sides of the British pattern it would rebound at any range. However, a
shot is very unlikely to hit the sides of the shield, and probably the
mere shock of a big projectile would effectually displace everything
and put the turret out of action. Wherever a big projectile hits it
must do some harm, whether it gets through or not, and the old American
idea of battering in preference to penetration is not so unsound as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
many folk are now disposed to regard it. Especially must this be so
with certain foreign-built ships; the least little thing wrong and the
colossal blow will find it out.</p>

<p>The guns and mountings of the Asahi are from Elswick. They embody some
slight improvements upon those of the Shikishima, but are on exactly
the same general principle. The 12-in. can easily do a round a minute,
and should be able to do a round every two minutes in action. The rate
of the 12.5-in. Canet gun at Yalu was one round per sixty minutes, but
there were special circumstances involved. Still, there is no doubt
that big guns have made enormous strides towards quick-fire in the last
year or two, and two of the Asahi or Formidable 12-in. are equal to
three of those in the Majestic probably.</p>

<p>The Asahi is fitted with the Barr and Stroud transmitters, each
casemate having an indicator—in English and Japanese—to give the
range automatically from the conning-tower. The official British view
is against these transmitters, on the grounds that action will derange
them; but there is no getting away from the fact that, even so, till
deranged they will be exceedingly useful. Our methods of passing the
range are cumbersome, and, in addition, by the time it is passed it has
probably altered. Moreover, gunnery is not so much a matter of good
shooting as knowing the range; the wrong range given accounts for most
misses—at any rate, in the British Navy.</p>

<p>All the hoists in the Asahi are electrical, with auxiliary hand-power
in case of need.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>All the ships have twenty-five Belleville boilers each, fitted with
economisers.</p>

Terni armour reduced to 4½ ins. at the ends, and reinforced by a
deck 1½ in. on the slopes.</p>

<p>Above the main belt is a 6-in. redoubt, with 4¾ in. ends, above
again a 6-in. battery containing ten 6-in. guns.</p>

<p>The primary guns are protected by 5½-in. armour.</p>

<p>The remaining 6-in. guns are carried without protection on the upper
deck. Six 12-pounders are carried between them, the remainder under the
poop and forecastle.</p>

<p>The torpedo tubes are in special casements.</p>

<p>The ships originally had a single military mast, but just before
completion the fighting-tops were removed.</p>

<p>They are the heaviest-armed armoured cruisers of their size in the

this superiority is manifest.</p>

The Bayan is the product of La Seyne. She is somewhat faster, better
protected by 2 ins. on the water-line, but less protected on the guns,
and with only half as many. She would take more punishment than the
Nisshin and Kasuga; but, given equal crews and tactics, the heavy fire
of the Nisshin type would seem to convey an immense advantage.

<h3>PROTECTED CRUISERS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
three ships Takasago, Kasagi, and Chitose, are slightly improved
editions of the Yoshino already described. The first was built at
Elswick, the other two in America.</p>

<p>There are slight differences in dimensions, otherwise the description
of the Yoshino stands for them. The armament is not quite the same as
in the Yoshino, as these three later vessels carry two 8-in. guns in
heavy turrets, ten 4.7’s on the broadsides, and 12-pounders instead of
6-pounders.</p>

<p>They are very fast, but the heavy gun turret forward does not improve
their behaviour at sea. <i>Per contra</i>, the 8-in. guns give them
the power to deal a knock-out blow to other cruisers of their size;
so their value depends on whether scouting or fighting is the more
important <i>métier</i> for a second-class cruiser. The Yoshino type is
intended to be both, and the Yoshino herself in a great measure is; the
others are too heavily armed to be ideal scouts.</p>

<p>The Niitaka and Tsushima were launched in 1902. A sister, the Otawa,
was laid down in 1903. They are improved Sumas, and entirely of
Japanese design and construction.

<h3>DESTROYERS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japan</span>
has selected two types of destroyers, the Yarrow and the
Thornycroft. The Thornycroft boats are practically replicas of similar
boats in the British Navy, and the Yarrow boats do not greatly differ,
except that they have the usual Yarrow stern.</p>

<p>Details will be found in the <a href="#Page_394">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>The feature of most interest concerns the disposition of the guns—the
12-pounder being carried aft instead of forward. This is a preferable
system to the usual one of the 12-pounder forward, as the bow is thus
less weighted down.</p>

<p>Mention may also be made of the fact that a railway is fitted on deck
for the conveyance of torpedoes. This is convenient, but the raised
rails are apt to get in the way of the crew a good deal.</p>

<p>In the war with Russia the Japanese destroyers appear to have stood the
strains to which they have been subjected remarkably well, and no cases
of “broken backs” and similar catastrophies which had been foretold
seem to have occurred.</p>

<p class="spa2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span></p>

<h3>TORPEDO BOATS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Till</span>
recently, the fastest Japanese torpedo boat was one captured
from the Chinese at Wei-hai-wei. Some very fast boats were built
in the period 1898-1901, the types being Normand and Yarrow (Viper
type), mostly the former. Details will be found in the <a href="#Page_394">Appendix</a>.
Some recent boats reached 29 knots on trial, and they are practically small
destroyers.</p>

<p>The early Japanese torpedo boats were of the “second-class” variety,
usually of the Normand or some similar French type, and the boats which
sealed the fate of the Chinese Fleet at Wei-hai-wei were mostly of this
pattern.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br> THE NEW PROGRAMME</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
new programme began, in 1904, with the ordering of two 16,400-ton
battleships at Elswick and Barrow respectively. They have been named
Kashima and Katori.</p>

<p>The following description of the Elswick battleship appeared in the
<i>Engineer</i>:—</p>

<p>Her length on the water-line is 455 ft.; her breadth, 78 ft. 2 ins.;
her draught, 26 ft. 7½ ins.; and her displacement, in tons, 16,400;
and she will carry for her armament four 12-in. guns, twin mounted in
barbettes; four 10-in. guns, mounted singly in barbettes; twelve 6-in.
guns in the citadel; twelve 12-pounder guns; six Maxim guns; three
3-pounder guns; and five torpedo tubes. The plan shows the disposition
of the above-named armament, the arrangement of which has been most
carefully considered, so that there is no interference with one another
in the firing of the different guns, which, however, are all capable of
being trained through large arcs. The 12-in. guns are 26 ft., and the
10-in. 22 ft., above the water-line. The 6-in. guns in the battery are
from 13 ft. to 14 ft. above the water-line.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>The general disposition of the armour protection is that adopted in
the latest and most powerful battleships, the armour amidships being
carried from below the water-line right up to the upper deck. Above
the level of the upper deck additional protection has been adopted, a
4-in. screen being worked to a height of 7 ft. 6 ins. above the upper
deck, and extending between the 10-in. gun positions. The main armour
belt, which extends the whole length of the vessel, has a thickness of
9 ins. for more than half its length, tapering to rather less at the
extremities. The depth of this belt is from 5 ft. below water to 2 ft.
6 ins. above water. Immediately above this is a belt of 6-in. armour,
extending in length from the after 12-in. barbette right forward to
the stem. Above this again is the 6-in. citadel armour carried to the
height of the upper deck, and enclosing the two 12-in. barbettes. In
this citadel are placed ten of the 6-in. guns, divided from one another
by screens of 80-lb. armour plating, and firing through ports similar
to those adopted in casemates. This citadel arrangement, which is one
of the most important features of this and other recent battleships,
is really a revival or development of the old box battery arrangement
adopted in some of our battleships built in the seventies, such as the
Shannon and Alexandra. This arrangement fell into disuse when the great
improvement made in ordnance—which for a time kept so far ahead of the
improvements in armour—made it necessary to increase the thickness of
the armour to make it efficient, and therefore it was only possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
cover a comparatively small area of the vessel’s side. However, the
recent improvements in armour have been such that again comparatively
thin armour is efficient in keeping out projectiles, which has once
more made it possible to protect a greater area of side. In more recent
years the same system with protective divisions between the guns in the
battery was adopted in the Nile and Trafalgar, but as the 4-in. armour
protecting the battery of each of these vessels was not of a quality
to keep out even the smaller armour-piercing shell, the system was
not repeated until the latest and most improved armour was adopted in
such vessels as our King Edward VII. class, and in the much-talked-of
Swiftsure and Triumph. The remaining two 6-in. guns fire through
similar ports in the 4-in. screen armour on the upper deck amidships.
The barbette armour of the 12-in. guns is 9 ins. thick on the upper
portions where exposed, and 5 ins. thick where protection is afforded
by the citadel armour. The barbette armour of the 10-in. guns has a
thickness of 6 ins., the conning-tower armour is 9 ins. thick, and
the observer tower 5 ins. thick. In addition to these two armoured
positions for commanding officers, three officers’ shelters are to be
built of 3-in. armour, one above the conning-tower and one on each
side. Besides the armour described above, a steel protective deck runs
throughout the entire length of the vessel, the whole of the machinery,
magazines, etc., being kept below. This protective deck has a thickness
of 2 ins. on the flat portions amidships, and 3 ins. on the sloping
sides, which are carried down to meet the bottom of the main armour
belt. At the ends where the armour protection is reduced, this deck
has a thickness of 2½ ins. all over. Thick protective plating is also
worked on the top of the screen armour at the boat deck level.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img id="P_221" src="images/p221_ill.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
Special attention has been paid to the arrangement and disposition
of the magazines, so that the ammunition can be got to all the guns
with the greatest speed and minimum of trouble. There are independent
magazines for each pair of 12-in. guns, and for each 10-in. gun, and an
ammunition passage is provided running right round the machinery spaces
below the protective deck for the supply of ammunition to the various
6-in. and smaller quickfiring guns. The torpedo tubes are situated
in watertight chambers—two tubes forward and two aft firing on the
broadsides, and one tube firing right astern, also under water. Special
means are provided for rapidly clearing water from these submerged
torpedo-rooms in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The general particulars of the main propelling machinery and boilers
are as follows: There are twenty Niclausse boilers disposed in three
separate boiler-rooms. These boilers will have a working pressure of
230 lbs., and a grate surface of 1300 sq. ft., and a heating surface of
43,000 sq. ft. The twin engines will have four cylinders each, of 36
ins., 56 ins., 63 ins., and 63 ins., with a stroke of 48 ins., and the
horse-power will be sufficient to give a speed of at least 18½ knots.
The coal bunkers are so arranged as to reinforce the protection given
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
by the armour and protective deck to the engines and boilers, whilst
their disposition is such as to require very little trimming to get
the coal to the furnaces. The bulk of the coal can also be got to the
stokeholds without opening any of the doors in the main watertight
bulkheads—a point of very great importance when the vessel is in
action. In addition to the coal bunkers below the protective deck,
reserve bunkers are arranged on the slopes of the protective deck up
to the height of the main deck over the length of the machinery spaces
amidships, the total capacity being approximately 2000 tons, which is
sufficient to give the vessel a very large radius of action.</p>

<p>A very complete outfit is being provided for the vessel, including the
following boats: Two 56-ft. vedette torpedo boats of high speed, one
36-ft. steam pinnace, one 40-ft. launch, one 32-ft. pinnace, three
30-ft. cutters, two 30-ft. gigs. For lifting these boats two powerful
electrically worked derricks are provided—one on each side of the vessel.</p>

<p>There is also a powerful electrical equipment, both for providing
energy for the numerous machines on board, and also for lighting.
The latter will include provision for six searchlights and some 1250
incandescent lamps.</p>

<p>The equipment of anchors and cables includes three stockless bower
anchors of 120 cwt. each, and other smaller anchors. There are also
three main cables of 150 fathoms each of 2⅝ ins. stud chain.</p>

<p>The vessel being of such an immense weight—over 17,000 tons with her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
full equipment of coal, stores, etc.—special arrangements have been
provided for docking her with safety, and, in addition to shoring
ribbands for giving special support to the armour in dock, two docking
keels are provided on the flat portions of the bottom under the bilges
amidships. These keels will rest on separate lines of blocks in the
dock, as well as the usual blocks along the middle line of the vessel.
Bilge keels are also provided to reduce rolling in a seaway.</p>

<p>The watertight subdivision of the vessel is of a most thorough
description; the inner bottom extends over the whole length of the
vessel, and is minutely subdivided, and above this the number of
transverse and longitudinal watertight bulkheads is too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>An elaborate system of pumping and draining has been worked out, and
in addition to the main pumps in the engine-rooms, which can be used
in case of emergency for dealing with a large inrush of water, are two
9-in. pumps, two 5½-in., and one 4½-in., besides pumps for fresh and
salt water services.</p>

<p>In a vessel of this description the ventilation arrangements are not
the least important of the many items which have to be thought out,
and every precaution has been taken for efficiently ventilating spaces
both above and below the protective deck. In addition to the natural
ventilation, artificial means have to be largely adopted, even in the
upper portions of the vessel where she is entirely enclosed in with
armour and protective plating, and here, as well as below the protective
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
deck, numerous electrical fans, with air trunks, branches, pipes, etc.,
are being provided for.</p>

<p>Two complete sets of steering engines, independent of one another
and in separate watertight compartments, are fitted, with steering
positions both forward and aft. Hand gear is also provided, and
appliances for changing as quickly as possible from hand to steam
gear, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Tiller indicators are fitted in all the
steering and conning-tower positions. Helm signals are provided for
the purpose of communicating the position of the helm to other vessels
in the neighbourhood. Voice-pipes, telegraphs, and telephones are
fitted throughout the vessel to communicate between all the important
positions. The vessel is also to be supplied with a wireless telegraphy
installation. Torpedo net defence is to be fitted around the greater
part of the vessel, which, in view of recent experience, appears to be
not an unnecessary precaution.</p>

<p>With the exception of the main propelling machinery and boilers, which
are being supplied by Messrs. Humphrys, Tennant and Co., the whole of
the ship, with armour, armament, fittings, etc., will be supplied by
Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth and Co., Limited.</p>

<p>The 12-in. guns will weigh approximately 59 tons each. The length is 46
ft. 9½ ins. (46.7 calibres). The weight of the projectile is 850 lbs.
The charge will be cordite, probably of the modified type. The exact
weight of the charge is not yet fixed, and neither can the velocity be
given, but these guns will be the most powerful 12-in. guns which have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
yet been constructed. No armour which any ship can carry can hope to
cope with their penetrating powers at 3000 yards. The breech-screw is
arranged for a parallel motion, which obviates the necessity of having
a steep cone at the seating of the obturating pad. It is yet early to
speak of the rapidity of fire to be obtained with these guns, but it
is anticipated that, in conjunction with the mounting described, the
hitherto obtained rate of approximately two rounds per minute from each
gun will be exceeded.</p>

<p>The 10-in. guns will weigh approximately 34 tons each. The length is
39 ft. (46.76 calibres). The weight of the projectile is 500 lbs. The
charge will be cordite, probably of the modified type. As in the 12-in.
guns, the exact weight of the charge has yet to be fixed, but here
again this will be the most powerful gun of its calibre in existence.
As a gauge of the power of these guns, it may be noticed that their
penetrating power is equal to the penetrating power at 3000 yards
of any of the 12-in. guns at present afloat in any navy. The breech
mechanism will be somewhat similar in design to that of the 12-in., and
will embody all the essential advantages of that design. The rapidity
of fire of these guns on the Elswick mounting it is anticipated will
at least be at the rate of three rounds per minute with a well-drilled
gun’s crew.</p>

<p>The 6-in. guns will weigh approximately 8½ tons. The length is 23 ft. 6
ins. approximately (47 calibres). The weight of the projectile is 100
lbs. The charge will be probably M.D. cordite; but here again this is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
not definitely fixed, but these guns will be the most powerful guns
of their description made, having a penetrating power at 3000 yards
equal to, if not exceeding, any 6-in. guns hitherto built. The breech
mechanism will be of the Elswick modified coned type, actuated by the
single motion of the lever, and, as in the other gun, the necessity for
the steep-coned obturator is obviated. The exact type of the smaller
guns is not yet settled, but they will also follow the general advances
in power and efficiency noted in the case of the heavier armaments.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">12-in. Gun Mountings.</span></h3>

<p>The 12-in. guns are mounted forward and aft on the midship line, as
shown in the sketch on the ship. Owing to the powerful nature of the
guns, these mountings are necessarily stronger than any hitherto
manufactured in this or any other country. The design is arranged
with a view to occupying the least possible space in the ship, and,
at the same time, to give ample room for working the machinery. The
general features of the design are the turn-table proper containing the
mountings for the gun, the working chamber underneath into which the
ammunition is received from the magazine and shell-rooms in preparation
for sending up into the secondary or loading hoist, the trunk
connecting the working chamber with the magazines and shell-rooms, and
the hoist connecting the working chamber and the gun. This latter hoist
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
is so arranged that a gun can be loaded at any angle of elevation or
training. The charge for each gun, consisting of the projectile and the
cordite charge, the latter in two halves, is brought up at one time in
a loading cage, which is automatically stopped in its proper position
in line with the breech opening of the gun. It is then rammed home by
means of a chain rammer actuated by a hydraulic motor. The breech-block
of the gun is opened or closed by a hydraulic motor, thus enabling this
operation to be performed with great rapidity. In the working chamber,
by an ingenious arrangement, the projectile and the two halves of the
cordite charge are simultaneously transferred from the cage which works
in the trunk connecting the shell-rooms and magazines with the working
chamber, to the cage working in the hoist connecting the working
chamber with the gun position. The ammunition trunk is of a new design,
which enables the ammunition cage always to come to the same position
in the magazines and shell-rooms; but when it is brought up to the top
of the trunk the cage is in its proper position with respect to the
ammunition loading hoist, although the turret may be revolving at a
quick rate; or, in other words, the ammunition trunk does not revolve
at the bottom, but revolves with the turn-table at the top. The guns
are protected by 10-in. hard armour in the front, and 8-in. at the
sides and back. The feature of the turret is that it is quite balanced,
thus enabling it to be readily trained by hand, although the ship may
have a heel at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>There are three systems for performing the operation of training,
primarily by hydraulic power, and should this fail through any of the
piping being shot away, electric training gear can be quickly put into
operation; and finally, should this be disabled, the turret can be
trained by hand. Similarly the operation of elevating and depressing
the gun can be performed by working primarily by hydraulic power, and
then either by electric or hand. The operations of loading can also be
performed by hand should the hydraulic system be disabled. To safeguard
against accident by freezing in the intense cold which is found in
the China seas during the winter months, heating apparatus is fitted
throughout the turret installation. The gun mountings are so arranged
as to give the gun 18 deg. elevation and 3 deg. depression, a greater
range of elevation than has hitherto been provided for mountings of
this description. The training angle is arranged for 270 deg., that is
to say, from right ahead or right astern to 45 deg. before or abaft the
beam. The turret can be trained at the rate of one complete revolution
(viz. 360 deg.) per minute. In the shell-room, suitable overhead
hydraulic lifting and traversing arrangements are made for lifting the
shell out of the bays and placing them in the cage, but this operation
can also be done by hand should necessity require it.</p>

<p>The sighting of the guns is provided for by a central sighting station
and two side sighting stations, one on the left and the other on the
right. By an ingenious arrangement the captain of the turret is enabled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
by working one lever to train or elevate the gun or to perform both
these motions at the same time. Voice-pipes and other apparatus are
fitted to enable the officer in charge of the turret to communicate his
orders to the magazines and shell-rooms. A complete system of electric
circuits enables the guns to be fired from any one of the eight
positions either simultaneously or independently. Percussion firing
arrangements are also provided.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">10-in. Gun Mountings.</span></h3>

<p>Each 10-in. gun is placed in an armoured revolving gun-house, or
turret. The ammunition is sent up in a lifting cage from the magazine
and shell-room direct to the gun platform, each cage containing a
projectile and cordite charge in two parts. On reaching the gun
platform the projectile is quickly transferred to a hinged loading
tray fixed on the gun-cradle by means of an intermediate resting
tray, the cordite being transferred by hand to the loading tray. By
this arrangement three projectiles are always in waiting for loading,
ensuring rapidity of fire. The projectile and charges can then be
rammed into the gun by a telescopic hydraulic rammer. This rammer is
arranged to follow the gun in elevation or depression, so that it
always remains in line with the gun axis, enabling the operation of
loading to take place at any angle within the usual fighting limits.
The training of the gun-house is performed as in the case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
12-in., primarily by hydraulic power; then by electric, and finally,
if necessity occasions it, by hand, and, like the larger mounting, it
is balanced so that the operation of training by hand can be readily
performed although the ship may have a heel. The breech-block of
the gun is arranged to be operated either by hydraulic power or by
hand. The gun can be elevated by hydraulic power as in the 12-in.
The operations of training and elevating are performed by the single
motion of a lever. These guns also have the large range in elevation of
18 deg., with 3 deg. depression. The sighting of the gun is provided
for by two positions, placed on the right and the left of the gun
respectively. A complete set of electric firing circuits is fitted to
enable the gun to be fired from either of these positions. Percussion
firing gear is also provided. The guns are protected in front by 9 ins.
of hard armour, and on the sides and back 6 ins. The training angle is
from right ahead to 30 deg. before or abaft the beam, or a total angle
of 120 deg.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">6-in. Gun Mountings.</span></h3>

<p>The 6-in. guns are mounted on the well-known central pivot principle.
This principle was first introduced by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth
and Co., and has since been adopted for mounting guns of medium calibre
by all the Governments and armament constructors in the world. Briefly,
to describe this system, it may be said that the gun is mounted in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
cradle in which it recoils, the recoil being absorbed by an oil
buffer attached to it forming a part of the cradle, the piston of
which is attached to the gun. The cradle is mounted by means of
trunnions on a Y piece, which revolves on hard steel balls placed on
a fixed pedestal. This pedestal is bolted to the ship’s structure,
the elevating arrangements are attached to the cradle, thus enabling
the elevating gun number to work the gear even during the firing of
the gun without injury to himself. Telescopic sights are fitted in a
convenient position. Electric circuits are fitted to enable the guns to
be fired by the simple operation of pressing the trigger of a pistol.
Arrangements for percussion firing are also provided. A circular shield
is attached to the revolving Y piece, so as to keep the port opening in
the ship’s side blocked up at any angle of training. This port opening
allows for the guns to be trained through a range of 120 deg., viz. 60
deg. before the beam and 60 deg. abaft.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">12-pounder Gun Mountings.</span></h3>

<p>The 12-pounder mountings are similar in principle to the 6-in. above
described, but, of course, arranged to suit the smaller size of the
gun. They are protected by revolving shields attached to the Y pieces
by elastic stays.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Torpedo Tubes.</span></h3>

<p>The vessel carries four 18-in. torpedo tubes on the Armstrong-Whitworth

principle, which has been fitted to all the Japanese warships built
either in this country or abroad since the date of the Fuji and the
Yashima, which were the two first ships to have this apparatus. The
vessel will also be fitted with a torpedo tube for firing 18-in.
torpedoes in the line of keel astern. This also will be a special
design by the builders.</p>

<p>The ammunition supply to the 12-in. and 10-in. guns has been described
under the heading of mountings for these guns. The ammunition supply
for the 6-in. and 12-pounder guns is arranged for by supplying to each
6-in. gun an electrically driven ammunition hoist of the improved
Elswick design. These hoists will bring up the projectile and the
cordite charge, and maintain a continuous supply. The operation of
the hoist is extremely simple, and necessitates the minimum personal
attendance. The seaman working the hoist has only to start it in motion
and then keep it supplied with the necessary ammunition, which is
automatically discharged in a position best situated for the working
of the gun. The hoists for supplying the 12-pounder guns are of
similar design; eight of them will be placed in suitable positions for
supplying the 12-pounder guns.</p>

<p>There is also a patent slip, of which the rails are 750 ft. long, the
breadth 30 ft., and the lifting power in tons 1200.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Nagasaki was an old Dutch station;
but the present Tategami yard was established about the time of the
Crimean War, by the Tokugawa Government, with the assistance of Dutch
engineers. After the civil war it was taken over by the Imperial
Government, who in 1884 sold it to the Mitsu Bishi Company, to which it
now belongs.</p>

<p>This company built the present granite dry docks. In 1889 they had
begun to build ships—a tug of 206 tons gross being their first effort.
Since then quite large vessels have been constructed, not always with
success; but, as an invariable rule, the failures on one have led
to successes on another, and the yard is now a very going concern,
employing about 4000 men.</p>

<p>The harbour and docks are extensively used by men-of-war.</p>

<p>As yet, judged by European standards, no really excellent work has been
turned out at Nagasaki. The main trouble has been with riveting; but
this is being steadily overcome, and it is purely a question of time
before ocean greyhounds will be turned out at this yard.</p>

<p>The work is not entirely Japanese; “stand-by” Westerners still exist.
These are kept in the background, in case their services are needed.
So far as I can gather, they are not requisitioned unless a difficulty
occurs, which is another way of saying that they are less and less
in demand. The majority of these stand-by men have Japanese wives,
and have adopted Japan as their country; as often as not they are
naturalised Japanese subjects.</p>

of Japan. There are two approaches, on the west and on the south-east,
but only the first is possible to big ships. In the centre of the
western entrance is a large shoal, three and a half fathoms below
low-water mark, leaving very deep channels close inshore on either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
side. As the whole entrance is only some two thousand yards wide,
flanked by high hills, it will be seen that it is impregnable. Inside
is a large and very deep harbour, where the whole Japanese Fleet could lie.</p>

<p>The coaling station of Takeshiki lies six miles from the entrance
by water, and five as the crow flies. It is, however, only some
three thousand five hundred yards from a fourteen-fathom bay on the
south-east, and so susceptible to a long-range bombardment from this
quarter. It is to be bombarded also from several other east-coast inlets.</p>

and the lower ones seldom less than a thousand feet.</p>

<p>In 1901 the merchant navy of Japan (without Formosa) consisted of 1321
steamers of European type, of 543,258 tons; 3850 sailing vessels of
European type, of 320,572 tons; and 911 native craft above 200 “koku,”
of 415,260 “koku.”</p>

<p>In 1901 the total ships for foreign trade entered to the ports of
Formosa were 2017 of 184,192 tons, of which 140 of 125,222 tons were
steamers, 1877 of 58,970 tons were sailing vessels.</p>

<p>The total ships cleared the ports of Formosa were 1946 of 174,814 tons,
of which 139 of 118,912 tons were steamers, 1807 of 55,902 were sailing
vessels.</p>

<p>The principal steamship line is the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, the ships of
which are usually white with black funnels, and a white house-flag
carrying two red horizontal lines in the centre. It has a dozen good
steamers and many smaller ones. None are very swift, and so there are
none of any account as “armed liners,” supposing such craft even to be
of value. On the other hand, all are very useful as transports. Both in the
Chino-Japanese war and in the war with Russia they proved very valuable.</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
Japanese Naval Intelligence Department is, in my opinion, the
best in the world. In the popular view this is the characteristic
of the Russian one; but the Russian Intelligence Department hardly
lives up to its reputation. For the collection of immaterial facts
it is unrivalled, but the little it really gleaned of Japanese war
preparation was amply evidenced in February, 1904.</p>

<p>The Japanese, on the other hand, manage to find out nearly everything.
They have to a marked degree men eminently qualified for the task.
Where other nations employ agents, Japanese naval officers have always
been found ready to serve in the most menial capacities. Both at Port
Arthur and Vladivostok officers served as coolies, or as “native
servants,” being Japanese, Chinese, or Koreans, as it suited their
book. Whether any one man secured really valuable information is
doubtful; the benefits were secured rather by the patient sifting of
everything at Tokio.</p>

<p>It is said that the Japanese torpedo craft reached the Russian
battleships on February 8th by using Russian signals that they had
stolen the secret of. Far more probable is it that they had learned
them by long and patient observation.

<p>In 1903 the new programme was authorised, to spread over
a series of years.</p>

<p>The Chinese war indemnity paid for most of the ships of the
after-the-war programme. The war with China cost £3,595,400 for the
Navy, while the Army part totalled to £16,455,200.</p>

<p>Japan is not a wealthy country, and, but for the probability of war
with Russia, it is quite possible that the new naval programme would
never have been authorised—at any rate, on so extended a scale as now.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br> ENTRY AND TRAINING<br> OF OFFICERS</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Executive.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Theoretically,</span>
the Imperial Japanese Navy is a democratic institution;
actually, it is no more so than the British Army. All classes are
eligible for commissions, but, owing to the low rate of pay, only those
with some private means care much to become officers. Eighty-five per
cent. or so belong to the old fighting class, the Samaurai.</p>

<p>The regulations as to the entry of cadets are as follows:—</p>

<p>They must be between the ages of 16 and 19. On the day appointed they
must present themselves for a physical examination, and about 33 per
cent. fail to satisfy the medical board in this respect. The remainder
are then entered for a competitive examination in the following subjects:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span></p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Japanese literature.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chinese literature.</li>
<li class="isub2">English grammar.</li>
<li class="isub4">” &nbsp; dictation.</li>
<li class="isub2">English conversation.</li>
<li class="isub4">”    translation (English to Japanese</li>
<li class="isub6">and Japanese to English).</li>
<li class="isub2">Arithmetic.</li>
<li class="isub2">Algebra.</li>
<li class="isub2">Plain trigonometry.</li>
<li class="isub2">Elementary geometry.</li>
<li class="isub2">History (of the world).</li>
<li class="isub2">Geography.</li>
<li class="isub2">Elementary physics.</li>
<li class="isub2">Very elementary chemistry.</li>
<li class="isub2">Freehand drawing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Competition is severe; for each vacancy there are about five
competitors; consequently, of those that originally enter only about 15
per cent. become <i>ko-hoshi</i> (naval cadets).</p>

<p>The successful competitors are sent to the Naval College at Yetajima,
near Kuré (pronounced Kōūrā), where they remain three years, at the
entire expense of the Government nominally, but generally costing
something to their relatives.</p>

<p>Here they go through a very extensive course, which, in addition to a
number of subjects not specified here, includes:—</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Seamanship,</li>
<li class="isub2">Gunnery,</li>
<li class="isub2">Torpedo,</li>
<li class="isub2">Navigation,</li>
<li class="isub2">Field drill,</li>
<li class="isub2">Physics,</li>
<li class="isub2">Chemistry,</li>
<li class="isub2">Mechanical engineering (elementary),</li>
<li class="isub2">English,</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span></p>
and all the other subjects of the original competitive examination in
advanced stages.

<p>There is a feeling in Japan that this curriculum is rather too liberal
for the time allowed.</p>

<p>Some gunboats are attached to the college, and in these classes of the
cadets go out for a day or two’s practical instruction now and again;
speaking generally, however, the three years are shore-service.</p>

<p>After the three years at college a cadet becomes a <i>sho-i
ko-hoshé</i> (midshipman), and is sent to sea for one year in a
training ship (masted), drawing a trifling pay.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this period, when between the ages of twenty to
twenty-three, the midshipmen enter for a technical pass-examination
for <i>sho-i</i> (second-class sub-lieutenant). If he fails (as a
proportion do) he is put back six months. He then has a second try. If
he fails in this attempt his services are dispensed with for good and
all.</p>

<p>Passed midshipmen become sub-lieutenants, not by virtue of the
examination only, but in order of seniority obtained in the
examination, and as vacancies occur.</p>

<p>As sub-lieutenants they leave examinations behind them, but they have
to write essays on naval subjects. According to how the <i>sho-i</i>
does in these, he passes up through into the higher class of
sub-lieutenants. The best take about one year to become a <i>tchu-i</i>
(first-class sub-lieutenant), the worst take much longer.</p>

<p>After two years’ service as first-class sub-lieutenant a <i>tchu-i</i>
is eligible for promotion to <i>taï-i</i> (lieutenant).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>Promotion is entirely by selection in this and all senior ranks.
The very youngest age at which an officer can become a <i>taï-i</i>
is twenty-three. Twenty-four to twenty-five is nearer the average.
A non-promoted <i>tchu-i</i> is compulsorily retired at the age of
forty-two; but there are none so old as that.</p>

<p>After eight years’ service a <i>taï-i</i> is eligible for promotion
(by selection entirely) to lieutenant-commander. Thirty-one is the
youngest age for this. Lieutenant-commander is a distinct rank,
intermediate between lieutenant and commander. Its holder is entitled
to the courtesy rank of “captain,” and officially so addressed. In
command of a small ship he is a <i>scho-sa</i>; serving in a big ship
he is a <i>hojutsho</i> (gunnery lieutenant), <i>suirisho</i> (torpedo
lieutenant) or a <i>kokisho</i> (navigator).</p>

<p>A lieutenant-commander is selected for <i>tchu-sa</i> (commander)
without any definite service time.</p>

<p>Thence, still entirely by selection he can pass on upwards through
the usual higher grades of captain, rear-admiral, and vice-admiral
(<i>kan-cho</i>, <i>scho-sho</i>, and <i>tucho</i>). The average age
at which an officer becomes a <i>scho-cho</i> (rear-admiral) is
forty-five. The retiring age is sixty-five, but comparatively few live
so long.</p>

<p>To be selected for <i>taï-sho</i> (admiral), a <i>tucho</i> must have
been in command of a fleet two years, and, further, have been so in
actual war.</p>

<p>A higher nominal rank still exists of admiral of the fleet—destined
for a full admiral who has had meritorious war service in that rank;
but there are none at present.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Engineers.</span></h3>

<p>An officer enters for a <i>kika-no</i> (engineer) by competitive
examination identical with that for those of military rank already
described.</p>

<p>Those who pass are sent to Yokosuka, where they spend four years
training in the technique of their profession. After that they join
ships, having equivalent rank with, but after, the military branch,
according to the table on a later page.</p>

<p>Engineers in the Japanese Navy have power to punish their own men,
being executive in their own department. They are not, however, granted
military titles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Doctors.</span></h3>

<p>A doctor (<i>quini</i>) is now a civilian who has a fancy for the
sea-service. Like engineers, doctors have equivalent rank with, but
after, the corresponding military branch, and are eligible for pensions
after twenty years’ service.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Paymasters.</span></h3>

<p>A paymaster (<i>shukei</i>) is also a civilian, entered as doctors are,
and serving under the same conditions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Constructors.</span></h3>

<p>The constructor (<i>losin-sokun</i>) enters by competitive examination
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
much as executive and engineers do. After passing he is attached
to a dockyard, and then sent abroad, usually to England, to learn
more than he can acquire in Japanese dockyards, where only small
ships are built as yet. A constructor has equivalent rank with
the executive, just like the other non-military branches. All
these branches at times use for themselves a military title; thus,
<i>taï-i-kikano</i> (lieutenant-engineer) or <i>taï-i-losin-sokun</i>
(lieutenant-constructor); but the military branch being, naturally
enough, jealous of their titles, the prefix is non-official, and never
applied to civil branches by the executive. Of the civil branches,
constructors most often get the military title, and in the dockyards
are always addressed by the employés as <i>taï-i</i>, <i>houk-cho</i>,
or <i>kan-cho</i>, without the word constructor at all. In the British
Navy, of course, constructors are almost as entirely civil a profession
as Admiralty clerks, and are absolutely unknown to naval officers afloat;
but in the Japanese Navy the tie is closer, and every officer knows them.

Warrant and chief warrant officers in the Japanese Navy never undertake
watch-keeping as in the British Navy. In no cases do they mess with the
commissioned officers, as in our destroyers, torpedo boats, and torpedo
gunboats, but, even in destroyers, have always their own mess.</p>

<p>They are not eligible for promotion to commissioned rank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI<br> PAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Pay</span>
in the Japanese Navy is, save in one important particular (mess
allowance), very much on all-fours as to system with pay in the Russian
Navy. There is, in all ranks, the same distinction between shore pay
and sea pay, only, unlike the Russian, the Jap is not confined inside
his harbours by Nature for two-thirds of the year.</p>

<p>Like Russian pay, too, it varies according to the station and varying
living expenses. The distinctly Japanese element—and a very democratic
one to boot—is that mess allowance is the same for all ranks: an
ordinary seaman, a lieutenant, and a vice-admiral all draw exactly the
same sum for messing, and that the modest one of 4<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.
and a fraction per week—a pound a month. The idea of the Japanese
Government appears to be admirable enough in theory; it has certainly
the merit of simplicity.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the cost of living in Japan is about
one-third the cost of living in the same style in England, about half
the cost of living in Russia, and one-fifth the cost in the United States.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>Details of pay for the various ranks are as follows:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap fs_120">Officers.</span></h3>

<p>Naval cadets and engineer students, while at college, are allowed £5
(50 yen) a month to cover all expenses.</p>

<p>Midshipmen, during their year at sea, receive £3 a month.</p>

<p>Sub-lieutenants get from £3 5<i>s</i>. to £4 a month, plus a sea
allowance of £1 a month and the £1 mess allowance. Altogether they draw
about £70 a year, the equivalent of £200 a year in England; while, if
serving abroad, their sea allowance is nearly trebled. It is said to
be practically impossible for sub-lieutenants to live on their pay. A
first-class sub-lieutenant draws £5 a month as ordinary pay.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Lieutenants and Equivalent Ranks.</i></p>

<p>Lieutenants draw £8 a month, plus a sea allowance of from £1 to £8
per month, according to the station. Exclusive of mess allowance, a
Japanese lieutenant in England gets a little under £200 a year—more or
less the same as a British naval lieutenant.</p>

<p>Flag, gunnery, and torpedo lieutenants draw some additional pay for
these duties. Unlike British specialists, all specialist lieutenants
are watch-keepers in the Japanese service.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p class="f110"><i>Lieutenant-Commanders.</i></p>

<p>A lieutenant-commander is paid £10 a month, while his sea allowance
varies from £2 to £12, according to the service on which he is engaged.
Destroyers are lieutenant-commanders commands, and those who are
captains of destroyers draw more accordingly than those serving in big
ships as senior lieutenants.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Commanders.</i></p>

<p>Commanders are paid £15 a month. Sea pay ranges from £2 10<i>s</i>.
to £10—the maximum in a big ship; but if captain of a gunboat, a
commander’s sea pay may rise to £15.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Captains.</i></p>

<p>The pay of a captain is £22 a month. Sea pay runs from £3 to £16. He
may also draw additions for entertaining expenses.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Rear-Admirals.</i></p>

<p>Rear-Admirals draw £29 a month, and the extra sea pay may run to £23,
plus entertaining allowances.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Vice-Admirals.</i></p>

<p>Vice-admirals draw £35 per month ordinary and £30 extra sea pay. In
Japan this is equivalent to over £2000 a year in comparison with life
on the English scale.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p class="f110"><i>Admirals.</i></p>

<p>The pay of admirals is fixed at £52 per month and £30 sea allowance.</p>

<p>In addition to these sources of pay, all officers on the active list in
the senior ranks are eligible for extra pay—a species of good-service
pensions. Meritorious conduct and medals are qualifications.</p>

<p>Engineers, doctors, and paymasters draw identical pay with the
corresponding naval ranks, and extra pay for special duties.</p>

<p>Constructors are on the same footing.</p>

<p>The equivalents in the different branches are:—</p>

<h3><span class="smcap fs_120">Men.</span></h3>

<p>Ordinary seamen get 7<i>s</i>. a month. In addition, they have a
varying sea allowance. The pay of seamen ranges up to 30<i>s</i>. a
month, plus sea allowance. Altogether the average Japanese sailor,
while in England, gets about 3<i>s</i>. a day.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Petty Officers.</i></p>

<p>The normal pay of petty officers, according to class and length of
service, runs from 17<i>s</i>. to £2 a month, with allowances extra.</p>

<p class="f110"><i>Warrant Officers.</i></p>

<p>Warrant officers draw from £3 to £5 a month, with numerous allowances.</p>

<p>Allowances to the men include clothing, or money for clothing, etc.</p>

<p>Altogether the Japanese sailor is very well paid. In our naval ports he
is looked on as something of a Crœsus. He spends his money freely, as
all sailors do, and his purchases run to practically everything, from
top-hats to trinkets, and heavy technical books to musical instruments.
Many of them talk English, and still more are able to read it, and
these are prone to buy books. It is quite a common thing for them to
tender five-pound notes in payment; but further particulars of this
sort will be found under the head of <a href="#Page_278">Personal Characteristics</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span></p>

<h3>RETIREMENTS, PENSIONS, ETC.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span>
already stated, the retiring age (nominally) of a sub-lieutenant is
42. Other officers are retired <i>pro rata</i> up to 65 years of age
for vice-admirals.</p>

<p>Officers of good conduct are promoted on retirement as a rule. Pensions
vary from a minimum of £20 to £76 per annum upward in each case. In the
admirals’ ranks, the minimum ranges from £105 to £150 per annum. There
is no exact maximum.</p>

<p>Intentionally or otherwise, there is one excellent thing that obtains
in the Japanese Navy. By the system of selection of captains to be
admirals the “duffer officer” has little chance of blocking the way
of better men. He, however, as a rule is ready to recognise his own
shortcomings, and it is not at all uncommon for such officers to
exhibit their patriotism by retiring to make room for those who are
likely to do better than they. It is only in the Japanese Navy that
this happens: and it is in very marked contrast to certain other navies.

comparatively quite recent times the Japanese naval ensign was the
same as the present jack and mercantile flag. The first battleships
flew this white flag with the red ball, and the now well-known Japanese
naval ensign only dates from the Itsukushima. It is very rarely
correctly represented. The accompanying <a href="#P_274">illustration</a>
shows it as it actually is; usually the sun is put in the centre
instead of in its proper place.</p>

<p>Admirals’ flags are remarkable in that they follow the Russian system
of marking by bands at the edges, instead of the almost universal balls
or stars which other nations employ.</p>

<p>The other flags illustrated do not call for comment to any extent, as
they follow existing custom in all navies.</p>

<p>The device on the Imperial Standard is the national chrysanthemum. It
is the personal flag of the Emperor. This badge, by the way, is found
upon the device on the caps of all officers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japanese</span>
officers’ full-dress uniform is very like full-dress English.
The difference lies in the sword, which is a dirk, and the cap, which
is rather Russian in shape, and has a gold band round it.</p>

<p>The reefer jacket does not exist. In place of it they wear a dark blue
military undress tunic, buttoning at the neck with stand-up collar, and
black braid down the front. There are no gold insignia of rank; these
are of black braid, with a loop for the military branch, just like
the gold ones. Engineers, paymasters, and doctors have their stripes
in black; but, being without the mauve, white, or red distinguishing
badge between the stripes with their undress, it is impossible to
distinguish. Cocked hats and frockcoats are identical with ours. Owing
to the extra number of ranks, the stripes vary slightly from ours. They are:—

<p>These are the usual gold stripes.</p>

<p>Admirals have stripes just like ours. No special illustrations of these
various stripes are given, as the photographs of officers of different
ranks throughout the book show them clearly.</p>

<p>There is no dress uniform in the Japanese Navy, but the national kimino
is often worn at dinner.</p>

<p>Constructors wear a uniform identical with that of paymasters in
undress.</p>

<p>Warrant officers wear a uniform closely akin to that of commissioned
officers. Ordinary warrant officers have no stripes. Chief warrant
officers wear a half stripe.</p>

<h3>(2) <span class="smcap">Men.</span></h3>

<p>The uniform of Japanese seamen is identical with that of British
seamen, save that the cap is a little flatter and nearer the French
shape. The cap ribbon is just like ours—the name of the depôt instead
of ship is on it in Chinese characters.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japanese</span>
naval officers, like as they are to European ones in many
characteristics, are yet of a more distinct class by themselves than
any other body of men in the world. The likeness to European officers
is superficial, a first impression; the real Japanese officer is not to
be known or understood at a casual glance; he needs knowing.</p>

<p>Whether the Western brain can ever get to truly comprehend the Oriental
is a favourite question, usually answered in the negative. But, true as
the negative may be in a general way, it is only true to that extent.
Sea service marks all its votaries as a class apart; and additionally
apart as the Japanese may be by race, they are not more so than
Russians or Frenchmen. It is just as easy or just as impossible to
“bottom” a Japanese as a Russian. Still, Japanese officers as a class
are, as before stated, a unique class.</p>

<p>Their primary and principal characteristic is that they are utterly
different to the Japanese that we read about in books. Art books tell
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
us of Japanese art instinct, of their feeling for decorative art,
and so forth. Japanese artists may possess, or have possessed, this
feeling, but it is conspicuous for its absence in Japanese naval
officers, who are as “Philistine” as British officers—if possible,
more so. The decorative art that their nation is supposed to live for
they cordially despise. I have never heard one admire a picture for its
colour, but light and shade (that decorative art knows not) appeals
to many. Effects, action, motion, sentiment they will understand, but
abstract art, never. They are truly and healthily “Philistines.”</p>

<p>So much for art, which I have touched on because it is said to be,
over here, the keynote of Japanese character. Illustrated as a good
deal of this work is with Japanese drawings and photographs, selected
for the book by Japanese officers, this matter deserves mention apart
from the question of artistic influence on national life. We may
note, therefore, that “art-instinct” was the first thing flung behind
him by the Japanese when he “advanced.” If the so-called taking to
civilisation of the Japanese means anything, it means having abandoned
art for something more utilitarian and more forceful.</p>

<p>Some slight recapitulation is now necessary. When Japan, as the
saying goes, “adopted Western civilisation,” she did little but adopt
Western methods of war and business, and, in the strictly ethical
sense, discarded a good deal of civilisation rather than adopted it;
she abandoned all those forms of civilisation that have a decadent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
tendency. Her advance was not the birth of a new empire with a new
civilisation, but the awakening of an old nation that for centuries had
been sleeping, steeped in ultra-civilisation. In this fact lies her
strength and her weakness.</p>

<p>A forgotten history was studied, and with that study slumbering
ambitions were revived. The man of action, relegated to the background
by ultra-civilisations,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
again began to loom upon the stage. Disputes with foreigners called him
on to it; Japan awoke determined to be again a nation. “Let us have
intercourse with foreigners, learn their drill and tactics, and ... we
shall be able to go abroad and give lands in foreign countries to those
who have distinguished themselves in battle,”—this sentiment every
Japanese officer has imbibed with his mother’s milk. The introduction
of Western social institutions, such as newspapers, railways,
telegraphs, the new criminal code, the abolition of torture as a
punishment, all these things are side issues. They have contributed
to build commercial Japan; but they have had small part in making her
Navy; the Navy, indeed, would perhaps have been stronger without them.
The mechanical arts and <i>the food</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
of the West, not its social institutions, have made the new Japan an empire.</p>

<p>Now, having decided to adopt Western methods, the Japanese sought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
Western instructors. The British being the premier navy, they sought
naval instruction from us, and were chiefly supplied with officers of
what even then was the “old school.” In one of Major Drury’s books
of naval stories<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
there is a British admiral who always read his Bible in his
shirt-sleeves, because the sight of his uniform made it difficult for
him to realise the existence of a Higher Power! Absurd, no doubt; but
this seemingly far-fetched yarn exactly represents the “old-school”
sentiment, and the sentiment upon which every Japanese officer has
been dry-nursed. Even to-day a British admiral is encircled with a
halo of pomp, formula, and etiquette equal to that of any Court; in
the old days the reverence was greater still. The young Japanese
officers’ first lessons in “sea-power” were in reverence to its chief
practitioners. With their reverential loyalty to their Emperor, they
proved apt pupils. As the seat of power the quarter-deck is revered in
the British service; lesson number two taught this to the Japanese,
and included the bridge and a few other places. Practical work they
were taught on our model; the theoretical they more or less taught
themselves. Japanese naval strategy and tactics are much less the
result of European tuition than we suppose. What they learnt from the
West was after the Nelson model.</p>

<p class="spa2">To understand a Japanese naval officer at all, we
must fully realise that he has been brought up with the things
mentioned above as his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[Pg
282]</span> religion—indeed, it is the only religion he knows. Whether
a professed atheist, or a Christian, or a Buddhist, the only semblance
of reality in his creed is this religion of “Sea-Power,” and the
worship of its visible embodiment. Such god as he has is the navy to
which he belongs.</p>

<p>We are more or less given to understand nowadays that Japan has
adopted Christianity. A Japanese told me that, to a certain extent,
they have. “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s,” struck him
as an excellent text for the common people—Cæsar being translated
Emperor of Japan. He preferred Christianity too, he said, “because it
was more modern and general.” Had the leading Powers been Mahomedan,
I have no doubt that official Japan would revere Mecca. It was, I
think, this same officer who told me that some friends of his who had
become Christians were anxious that he should do the same. He agreed,
therefore, to go and be baptised on a certain date <i>if it were
fine</i>. The day was wet, so he did not go. Some other friends were
anxious that he should embrace Buddhism. “As their temple was much
nearer, I went there,” he said; “so I am a Buddhist. But, of course, I
do not believe in any religion really.”</p>

<p>A Christian Jap, on the other hand, once asked me whether Santa Klaus
was one of our gods—the combination of monotheism and pantheism of the
Doctrine of the Trinity being altogether outside their philosophy.</p>

<p>Actually the Japanese are members of that “Agnostic Creed” which some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
of our greater materialists have preached, plagiarising both
Christianity and Buddhism. “Do unto others as you would that they
should do unto you.” And in a great measure they live up to it. Where
they seem not to, the difference between ideals of the Orient and the
West explains the omission. Our particular type of hypocrite is not
known in Japan. But, as I have said before, the only “Power” that they
recognise and worship is their fleet. To grasp the true inwardness of
this is not over and above easy to our mental processes, but it is the
keynote.</p>

<p>One might imagine that a far-seeing administrative brain had evolved
this most utilitarian religion, but I have never detected evidences
of purpose. The seed was planted by our “old-school” naval officers;
it fell on fruitful soil, and grew of its own accord into a weapon of
almost indescribable potency. It is not on the lines of fanaticism
exactly—the case of the Mahomedan is not altogether analogous. Rather,
it is on all fours with Calvinism.</p>

<p>“If people don’t like being killed, why do they fight?” a Japanese
officer remarked when discussing war. Individually and physically, a
Japanese officer is not at all brave, if we define “bravery” in our
sense of the word, but he will fight harder and die harder than any
Westerner. To him a wound taken in action is on a par with a toothache
or more serious ailment in ordinary everyday life; death in battle
he views as we view ordinary death in our beds. The risk of death in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
action is an idea that moves him about as much as an actuary’s table
affects us. Unlike the Mahomedan warrior, death in battle entails
no Paradise with beautiful Houris as a reward; nor does <i>dulce
et decorum est pro patria mori</i> seem to weigh much. Death is an
incident, nothing more. “If people do not like being killed, why do
they fight?” is the beginning and end of their ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>In every navy there are men who work at their profession and men who do
not. The Japanese Navy is no exception to the rule, but the proportion
of those who are casual is very small.</p>

<p>“Working at their profession” has, however, a very liberal meaning in
the Japanese Navy. It means the absolute ignoring of everything else. I
once inquired of a Japanese naval officer over here what the Japanese
military attaché was called. “I cannot tell you,” was the answer,
“<i>because I work at my profession</i>.”</p>

<p>And, judging by his expression, my friend was proud of this little bit
of evidence that he wasted no time on extraneous matters. This, too,
was in England. His ship was then in an elementary stage at Elswick; he
was at Portsmouth on leave.</p>

<p>The “working at his profession” in this particular case, of an officer
with his ship a mere skeleton on the building slip, consisted in
spending the day poring over naval books. I generally found him deep in
Mahan, with halma-pieces on sheets of paper to work out the tactics.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Speaking generally, a Japanese naval officer’s (in England) idea of a
holiday appears to be to come to Portsmouth, spend the day going over
the dockyard, with a visit to my house to play naval war-game into
the small hours as a kind of subsequent dissipation and relaxation!
Whatever naval Kriegspiel may or may not be, it takes a Japanese to
regard it as a dissipation.</p>

<p>In person, Japanese officers are very short, but the generality of
them are far more “physically fit” than popular opinion imagines. The
narrow-chested, sloping-shoulder variety is the exception, not the
rule. Many are very well proportioned indeed. Height averages about
five feet, or an inch or two over. In type of feature there is an
immense variety; though black hair, high cheek-bones, and narrow eyes
are common to all, general resemblance ends there. Colour varies much.
Some have the same pale, yellow complexion that one often meets with in
Russians; others have the more olive Italian tint. The former type have
the <i>nez retroussé</i>, usually small; the latter have a more or less
hooked nose. Features vary much according to the province or island
from which the owner hails.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Occasionally one encounters a swarthy officer, hailing from the
Northern islands, while here and there one meets a face almost
typically European.</p>

<p>In character they are all more or less after one model. Taking them in
the lump, they are the merriest lot I ever came across. No one enjoys
the “At Homes” which Japanese officers invariably give before their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
ships leave England more than the givers of them; they make the best
of hosts for that reason. These “At Homes” are a distinctive Japanese
feature; no other foreign visitors in our harbours ever give them. The
usual foreigner arrives, official calls are made, one or two of us
may perhaps be entertained on board, and there the matter ends. With
a Japanese ship, on the other hand, that is about where it begins. As
an old waterman on Portsmouth Hard observed, “One Japanee is worth a
dozen bloomin’ Rooshians and Eyetalians. Give me a Japper here once
a month and I’ll make my bloomin’ fortune,” the fact being that the
civil population, who never dare venture near a Russian, crowd on board
a Japanese ship in season and out, sure that, even if they are not
wanted, their invasion will be forgiven. I suppose the Japanese derive
some pleasure from watching the enjoyment of these self-invited guests,
though their good nature must be a trifle strained at times.</p>

<p>When the Shikishima was docked at Portsmouth, I happened to call,
with an officer of ours in uniform. In company with several of the
Shikishima’s officers, we were doing the round of the upper deck, when
a tripper of the regulation type suddenly confronted us, and addressed
my companion.</p>

<p>“One moment, sir!” he cried. “I want to see over the ship.”</p>

<p>My companion indicated the Japanese officers, telling the man to apply
to them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
“Bother the foreigners!” returned the man. “I was told that if I went
on board the officials would show me round. Can’t you send one of ’em?
You can tell ’em I ain’t a spy. I don’t mind showing ’em my card—at
least, no; I find I haven’t any about me. But here’s my return ticket
from London; they can see that if they want to. I assure you I’m not a
spy, or connected with the Press in any way.”</p>

<p>As all the Japanese understood and spoke English perfectly, this was
not the happiest of introductions. However, one of them volunteered
to show the tripper round, for which the tripper tendered thanks to
<i>our</i> officer. He then called out to a party of his friends on
the jetty that he had “managed to make one of the silly foreigners
understand,” after which he devoted himself to patronising his guide.
He meant no harm, doubtless, but it was a good deal of a tax on
Japanese politeness, and had he been kicked off the ship he would have
only had himself to thank for it. There are, unhappily, a good many
of these tripper-folk who, given an inch in the way of being allowed
on board at all, grab a good many ells in the way of taking advantage
of it. Nor is it only the tripper-folk who take undue advantage
of Japanese hospitality. At the “At Homes” I have seen women, who
certainly ought to know better, armed with scissors, with which they
cut down any decoration that takes their fancy. The sight of the
decorations does not make the Tenth Commandment easy to observe. At the
close of the “At Home,” the paper flowers are always all given away to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
the guests. But this sort of thing would never happen on board an
English ship in a Japanese harbour.</p>

<p>For an “At Home” the Japanese officers put all the men to work making
paper flowers. Chrysanthemums and cherry blossoms are the favourites,
but convolvuli and iris are also made, as well as a few others. All
are singularly beautiful and realistic reproductions—very different
things to the ordinary artificial flower of commerce. With these
flowers the greater part of the ship is profusely decorated, numbers
of lanterns are hung about, and here and there a “Welcome” is stuck
up. In addition, each ship hits on some device of its own; thus the
Kasagi went in for a host of Japanese and British naval ensigns, while
the Shikishima turned diving-dresses into decorative uses. Generally,
as in the <a href="#P_291">illustration</a> of the Kasagi’s “At Home,”
some sports make a programme, fencing, single stick, conjuring
tricks, and so on, with some Japanese songs in between the turns.
The Shikishima, however, before she left England, capped all these
things by rigging up a stage, scenery, platform, and all, upon the
quarter-deck, and here old Japanese plays, with the proper costumes and
everything, were performed, while the entire upper deck was transformed
into a paper flower-garden. I have attempted in the illustration to
give some idea of the fairyland thus created, but it needs colour to
give anything like the real effect.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
I have dwelt thus upon Japanese “At Homes,” because the way in which
the officers put themselves out to enjoy these, and make their guests
do the same, is an index to one of their leading characteristics. It
is a curious thing that no descriptions or illustrations of these gala
days of the Japanese war-god ever find their way into print. The whole
thing is essentially Japanese, and shows that Western drill and weapons
have not killed Oriental charm.</p>

<p>Beyond relegating art to its proper and inferior position, I do not
think that Western influence has altered Japanese character to any
great extent. A Japanese naval officer of some note, in relating
to me his experiences during the war against China, referred to a
combined naval and military operation in which he was engaged. Cholera
killed them off like rats. “It was one of the funniest sights I have
ever seen,” he said, “to see the soldiers all doubled up and rolling
about by the side of the road as we marched.” This frame of mind is
distinctly Oriental; it is also distinctly useful for a fighting-man.
A British bluejacket might have contrived to see the humour of the
situation also,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
but no other Westerner is so blest—for it is a case of blest; the
toughest warrior is the one that wins. Japan is not going to collapse
in a war while this sort of sentiment can obtain. Modern warfare is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span>
becoming more and more a matter of acting on the <i>morale</i> of the
<i>personnel</i>; it is on nerves rather than on bodies that shell-fire
is intended to have its most powerful effect, and it will take a good
deal of it, and a very deadly deal, to affect those who can see the
humorous side of what is primarily a very terrible thing. Probably the
root of the “war-instinct” lies somewhere hereabouts, and we should
think many times ere we endeavour to “humanise” such ideas out of our
own Mark Tapleys.</p>

<p>The Japanese also retains his old native dignity; European uniform has
not abated one jot of that dignity which we have all read about as
having been beneath the Kimino. Mostly, though not invariably, they are
the descendants of the old fighting men, the Samaurai.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
In the midst of the new order all the best of the old traditions live,
just as, in a few cases in our new social order, pauper members of old
families scorn the wealthy mushroom aristocracy around them. Whatever
he may do, in whatever position he may be placed, the Japanese officer
never forgets his dignity, and, further, is always a <i>gentleman</i>.
I believe this is the first impression that he creates; it is also the last.</p>

<p>On the whole, though their politeness generally hides it completely,
the Japanese are a very “touchy” and sensitive people. Quite
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
unwittingly one is apt to tread on tender corns, without in the least
realising it, until one gets to know them a good deal more than
casually. They are sensitive about any infraction of the extended laws
of etiquette, which they themselves observe most punctilliously. There
are numbers of little things to be learnt and observed by one who would
come to be on friendly terms with them, and I doubt if any Westerner
can acquire all. Still, if he offends through ignorance he will never
learn his fault from his hosts.</p>

<p>They carry this sensitiveness a considerable distance, and into a
variety of things. For instance, to see themselves represented in
print in broken English and queer pronunciation annoys them intensely.
An Englishman, seeing his rendering of a foreign language guyed,
would laugh at it; but not so the Japanese. I remember well the
indignation of a Japanese at reading in a Portsmouth local paper that
his countrymen had talked about their vessel as a fine “<i>sipp</i>.”
He did not like it at all. Incidentally, I may mention that “sipp” was
phonetically inaccurate; the majority say the word “ship” just as we
do, while the rest would merely give the “i” the same phonetic value
that it has in French, Italian, or Russian. On their part, I have known
Japanese deliberately pronounce many of their own ship-names wrongly,
so as not to offend English ears by emphasising an English error.</p>

<p>It is a legend in our navy that the first English word learnt by a
Japanese is always <i>Damn!</i> but I have only once heard a Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
use it. His own language is singularly defective in swear words.
Japanese learn English very rapidly, and soon grow to speak it
remarkably well. After a year, or less, in England they acquire not
merely a mastery of the English, but also a far more difficult thing
for a foreigner—a mastery of our <i>slang</i>. Ability to pick this
up argues a singularly quick brain, as dictionaries are of no avail
here. It is characteristic of them, too, to set about it with a serious
thoroughness, essentially Japanese. Recently a sub-lieutenant, not
long from the Far East, who had learnt school English out there, took
to studying a novel of mine, “The Port Guard Ship,” a book that deals
solely with social naval life, and so is loaded to the muzzle with
current naval slang and phraseology. Every time I met this sub. he used
to haul a notebook from his pocket, and reel off a list of slang and,
possibly, now and again, profanities culled from its pages, the exact
import of each of which I had to explain! In consequence that sub. is
now able to join in any conversation without difficulty, or without the
talk having to be suited for him. The Frenchman’s dilemmas over such
expressions as “Look out!” do not bother him at all. In fine, he knows
“English as she is spoke,” by virtue of adopting a method.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Japanese never learn to write English so well as they
speak it—thus reversing the condition of all other foreigners. Their
caligraphy is fine and bold always, but the phraseology as invariably
formal. Possibly it is due to the etiquette of letter-writing in their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
own country that their letters here almost always begin with a “Thank
you for your kind letter,” and continue formal all through.</p>

<p>Mentally, the Japanese is adaptive, not originative. If one is
explaining anything to a Japanese, he will have seized on the idea and
absorbed it while a European is still struggling with the externals
of it. Japanese invention has extended to a small quickfirer and a
water-tube boiler, but in both cases the invention is merely a change
of some existing mechanism. Even so, neither is of great moment; their
abilities do not lie in that direction at all. If an entirely new
system of naval tactics is ever evolved, it will not be by a Japanese;
like their British <i>confrères</i>, they shine better at practical
work than in the regions of theory.</p>

<p>They are not, however, devoid of views. Every Japanese gives time to
thinking of the future, and were any lieutenant suddenly made into an
admiral, I fancy that he would acquit himself quite as well as if he
had reached his rank by orthodox gradations. He is apt to fail now and
again at his present task from this trait, which is in many ways his
chief defect, and one that may lead to trouble in war. It is sometimes
dangerous to reason before proceeding to obey. A Japanese tends to
do this. It is details that they think about. For instance, I once
got a Japanese officer to give me his views on the conduct of a naval
war. They are worth quoting <i>in extenso</i>, because naval opinions
invariably run more or less in grooves.</p>

<p>His primary detail was strategical, and referred to the Press. “I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
have no correspondents with my fleet when I am an admiral in war,” said
he. “If they insist on coming, directly we get out to sea I shall set
them all adrift in a boat. If they do their duty to their papers they
are a hindrance to me; if they do not they are no good at all.”</p>

<p>Detail number two referred to his fleet. “I shall hoist the signal, ’No
ship is to surrender; if beaten, it must sink.‘ If any ship hoists the
white flag, the rest of my ships will open fire on it till it sinks.”</p>

<p>I shall watch this officer’s career with interest if ever he commands a
war fleet in the future, for he will go far; every detail was similarly
thought out. I fancy every Japanese who stands any prospect of being an
admiral in the future does the same, though the matter is not one upon
which they talk at all readily to a stranger.</p>

<p>It is also, however, their weakest point, this fondness for thinking
of the future. Too often they think of it unduly, and to the detriment
of the present. Not invariably, of course, still there is, I fancy, a
fair sprinkling of lieutenants who devote as much or more thought to an
admiral’s duty twenty years hence than to lieutenant work of to-day. It
is not, primarily, a bad thing so much as a good thing overdone; but
that is a Japanese naval characteristic all through. They are always
in more danger of overdoing a good thing than anything else. Curiously
enough, this tendency to think for the admiral does not lead to any
great evil in the way of an undue corresponding tendency to be critical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, a Japanese naval officer never underrates his own
abilities. Every junior officer feels in his inmost soul that he is
fully as capable and as fully able to do anything as his senior. None
of them suffer from false modesty. On the whole, this, within due
bounds, is by no means a defect; self-confidence is a fine thing for
begetting ability; but, as before stated, they are prone to overdo many
good things. Some of them, doubtless, overdo the confidence in their
own abilities.</p>

<p>They are, in a way, a discontented lot of men as a whole, despite
all their fatalism, their enthusiasm, and their joviality. Every
civilian officer fumes over to himself that he is not an executive;
every lieutenant curses the time that must pass before he is a
lieutenant-commander, and so on all through. Wherever they are in the
professions, they want to be better and higher. Sometimes this is a
defect, sometimes not. When it is a defect, it is again a case of the
good thing overdone.</p>

<p>With all this, however, they are not ambitious in the exact way that
we define the word. A friend of mine was appointed skipper of a
destroyer, to take her out to Japan. He had worried everything and
everybody for the post. Now, he could have gone back to Japan as a
passenger in a steamer, drawing more pay, and without the risks and
heavy responsibilities of being a destroyer captain; but, having got
his wished-for ship, there the matter ended. There was no “another
rung in the ladder” about it; it was simply “a good opportunity to get
experience.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>He got it. He left the Thames in a blizzard. Down Channel he had a
gale, a head sea, and a thermometer well below freezing-point. Not
having been to sea for some time, he was seasick continually, and
the weather gave him neuralgia and bronchitis in addition. Having a
crew new to the ship, he had to spend nearly the whole trip from the
Thames to Portsmouth on deck, and when he snatched a brief watch below
a defective cowl gave him shower-baths in his bunk. Yet, when he put
into Portsmouth Harbour to coal, I found him sitting in the wardroom,
expatiating to his officers on his good luck in having thus early been
favoured with some bad weather experience.</p>

<p>“Duty,” in the sense in which one finds it in the British or Russian
navies, is not much of a motive-power to Japanese officers. The
religion of war, the interest of their profession, the longing to put
theories to a fuller practical test—here lie the springs of their
motive-power. To quote one of them, they “like being killed.” I believe
they do.</p>

<p>Personal glory is, again, discouraged rather than otherwise; a
solidarity of glory is rather aimed at. In the torpedo attacks at
Wei-hai-wei some boats “got in,” some failed. No Japanese officer who
participated will tell you his share. I once asked one of these, whom I
met, about the famous action. “Oh yes,” said he, “I was there. It was a
very cold night.”</p>

<p>Subsequently I learnt from another officer that this particular one had
commanded the boat that sank the Ting Yuen. “But,” added my informant,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span>
“he would not tell you, and you should not ask. All did well; some were
lucky, some not; since all did well, they agreed not to speak of it
after and say who did this or did that, <i>for all were equally worthy
of praise</i>.”</p>

<p>Ethically our socialists theorise on this sort of thing, but only the
Japanese have actually practised it. Such are Japanese naval officers.
To sum up, they have little ambition, little thirst for personal glory,
but a good deal of thirst for the thunder of battle. The only religion
that they wot of is the worship of their fleet; their only heaven,
that fleet in action. They cannot originate, but they are peerless at
practising the things that they have learnt. And there is only one
possible way of beating a Japanese fleet—by sinking it.</p>

<p>In many of these things the trail of Samaurai may be visible. The
Samaurai were trained to kill and to be killed; it was the thing they
lived for. Take the case of the old Japanese duelling laws, which
ceased to exist quite recently comparatively. No French <i>affaire</i>
about these duels. To a Japanese serious European duels are as comic as
French duels are to us. With the Japs the vanquished had to die, only
death or a mortal wound stopped the duel, and the victor had then to
commit suicide.</p>

<p><i>Hari-kari</i>, though now illegal, is not yet entirely dead. It is
not very many years ago that a Japanese sub-lieutenant disembowelled
himself because of the disgrace of some affront that he felt had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
put on him; in the war with China there were one or two cases.
<i>Hari-kari</i> is not a nice thing to describe, and has been
described in detail often enough before to-day. It has altered
somewhat from the orthodox manner. The torpedo-gunner who, after his
frozen-in torpedo failed to leave the tube at Wei-hai-wei, committed
<i>hari-kari</i>, slit his stomach across with a knife, and then fired
a pistol at his throat—according to the captain of his boat, who told
me about it. This was not quite after the orthodox manner, but it
was a singular painful means of death for a man to choose of his own
accord. The ancestors of Japanese officers, near and remote, lived for
centuries under the <i>hari-kari régime</i>. In other ways human life
was cheap, and torture was common. Their descendants reap the results
in an age when war has become so much a matter of “moral effect.” And
this is one great reason why a Japanese fleet will have to be sunk
<i>en masse</i> for it to be defeated.</p>

<p>I will close this chapter with one anecdote, a trifle shocking to our
convictions possibly, but so eminently characteristic that I must give
it. One Japanese I know was studying naval history, noting the most
effective dying words of great commanders (the distant future in his
mind’s eye very probably). “They are pretty, some of them,” he said,
“but I do not think them very useful. Now, if I get killed, I think I
shall say, ‘I die a good Christian, and shall soon be an angel with
very pretty wings.’”</p>

<p>I can quite imagine him saying it, and his comrades finding the jest
useful.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I sometimes</span>
wonder who it was first coined that well-known phrase, “little Japanese
sailors.” As phrases go it is very “catchy,” but in the matter of
accuracy it is very general only. Save for Russians and Italians, some
of the biggest sailors going are Japanese. Beside their own officers
they look giants, while actually they average nearly an inch higher
than British bluejackets, and in breadth fully equal them. One and
all, they are fine men physically, able to hold their own in size with
almost any other nation’s bluejackets, except Russians and Italians.
They are almost invariably stout and well set up, and they are always
smiling; they take to their profession much as their officers do.</p>

<p>As previously stated, they are recruited chiefly from the northern
islands, and chiefly from the lowest classes. These make the bravest
sailors, and they have been educated from early youth upward into a
disregard for death. Till quite recently, most Japanese villages had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
feuds with neighbouring hamlets, and these resulted in a good many
broken heads and a fair amount of blood-letting, all of which the
Government, if it did not actually encourage, at least viewed with
a very lenient eye on account of its practical utility in rearing
fighters.</p>

<p>Japanese officers have, on the whole, a preference for sailors
of little education. Their view is that such are less hampered
by appreciating danger. Apparently some of the better class
sailors—artificers and others drawn from a rather better class
socially, acquire with their education an inconvenient ability to
realise some of the frightful dangers of modern naval warfare. Either
from experience or instinct, these more educated men are not looked on
with favour. “The less a man knows the better sailor he will make,” is
the saying.</p>

<p>A rabid anti-Japanese of my acquaintance, who has spent his life in the
Far East, allows the Japanese only one virtue—general and complete
bravery. “No Japanese,” said he, “is ever afraid.” It is not easy
to reconcile this statement with the Japanese estimate of educated
sailors given above; but I am not in a position to deliver a verdict
of any value on the question. The officers’ contempt of danger,
alluded to some pages back, has little bearing on the point. The fact
that “cowardice” exists as an offence in the Japanese naval code of
punishments may, perhaps, throw a little light upon the matter; but,
even so, we need an exact definition of what the word “cowardice” means
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span>
to a Japanese. It does not mean cowardice as we should understand it.
I incline to fancy that it means the absence of an utter disregard
for life; and that what the Japanese call a coward we describe as a
waverer—which is by no means the same thing. It is not impossible that
their more liberal definition of cowardice would include a man who got
unduly excited in action. After Yalu, several men were punished for that.</p>

<p>The general intelligence of Japanese bluejackets is high, they
have the national aptitude for “picking things up” with marvellous
rapidity—wherein they form a marked contrast to the Russian sailors,
who learn very slowly. They—some of them—also forget rapidly; a
national defect in Japan.</p>

<p>In many ways they are replicas of their officers. Like their officers,
their ideas of dissipation centre round learning something. Parties
of fifty or so “do” London and our chief industrial centres when they
are in England. On these occasions, and, indeed, always in foreign
ports, their behaviour leaves nothing to be desired. At Portsmouth,
where public houses are thick as can be, and where leave is given
very freely, a hundred or so will roam the town all day in groups,
fraternising and being made much of by the populace, but any disorder
or trouble with the police in consequence is almost unknown.</p>

<p>On shipboard drinking is said to be on the increase; but it is rarely
a cause of trouble, though a drunken Japanese is a nasty customer. Most
are temperate.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Stealing is practically unknown. Natural causes operate here. If by
any chance a Japanese sailor steals, he is a marked man. His shipmates
refuse to have any dealings with him whatever, he is an absolute
outcast; and his crime is passed on against him by his comrades
should he be sent to another ship. This perpetual ostracism is a most
effectual safeguard.</p>

<p>Till recently Japanese sailors were not over and above obedient. A
marked change has since sprung up, and they are now, as a rule, very
amenable and willing, as well as able. They still, however, need some
tact in management; and attempts to knife officers are not unknown.</p>

<p>Cleanliness is a national characteristic. Japanese sailors, like all
of the lower class in Japan, bathe more frequently even than the upper
classes—twice each day every Japanese sailor has a bath. If from war,
or any other cause, they are prevented from bathing for a couple of
weeks or so, the lower class Japanese suffer a great deal from skin
diseases. Hence they are ill-adapted for lengthy torpedo boat service.</p>

<p>In general neatness their average is high; on whatever work they are
engaged—except, of course, coaling ship—they are usually spick and span.</p>

<p>Despite his good qualities, however, the average Japanese bluejacket
is not on a par with his officers in value. He lacks stolidity; and,
take him all and all, he is inferior to a Chinese sailor. The Chinaman
is braver, or, rather, what the Japanese call braver. According to the
Japanese, Ah Sin is the finest material for bluejackets in the world,
and they are not alone in this opinion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>To return to the Japanese bluejacket. Like his officers, he has little,
if any, religion—though, nominally, a certain proportion may be
Buddhists or Shinto. They have, however, a species of semi-religious
code over some minor matters—for instance, no Japanese sailor will
accept a tip for small services, such as showing visitors round a
ship, or because he is coxswain of a boat in which you have taken
passage. According to their ethics, it is a <i>crime</i> to accept
special payment for anything done in the way of duty, and if a man by
any chance did accept anything, his shipmates would render his life
unbearable by their contemptuous ridicule of him. So, though they will
as readily and gladly take any amount of trouble for a stranger, to try
and give them a tip annoys them. I once kept a Japanese boat’s crew,
which had been sent for me, waiting a long time, on a bitterly cold
day, through some misunderstanding as to time. It was a long row to
the ship, against a strong tide, in which they were soon wet through.
Arrived at the ship, my first attempt to tip the coxswain was greeted
by a shake of the head. Thinking he had misunderstood my intention, I
repeated the attempt. He at once called out, “No. Go away!” in a most
indignant tone, and his whole expression was that of a man on whom I
had put a deadly insult.</p>

<p>Japanese sailors are very quick in everything. In the Far East brawls
between them and Russian sailors, before the war, were very frequent,
and though the Russians are physically much the superior, yet, from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
their quickness, the Japanese were more frequently the victors.</p>

<p>When Japanese sailors are in England, some of our missionary societies
keep an eye on them—taking them about, and generally trying to help
them. One old lady is particularly kindly remembered by the crews of
those destroyers that fitted out at the West India Docks. She gave the
crew of one of them a good many texts of the usual ornamental sort
when they left. They hung all these up, giving the post of honour to
one that said, “The wicked shall be destroyed.” They regarded this
as a very kindly compliment and good wish to their destroyer! I do
not think that the texts stand any chance of fulfilling a missionary
<i>rôle</i>—however, there they hung, in the fok’s’le, and over the
officers’ bunks in the wardroom also, in the hopes that “the old lady,
who had been so good to the men,” would derive some <i>quid pro quo</i>
in the way of satisfaction at the sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI<br> MESSING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span>
the Japanese Navy, as in ours, there are many messes—admirals being
by themselves, captains by themselves, and below them the wardroom,
gun-room, warrant officers, and petty officers’ messes.</p>

<p>The officers have three meals a day—</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Breakfast at 7.0 to 7.30 a.m.</li>
<li class="isub2">Lunch at 12 noon.</li>
<li class="isub2">Dinner at 7.0 p.m.</li>
</ul>

<p>The food is alternately English and Japanese—thus, one day there are
two meals European and one Japanese; the day following two Japanese and
one European. Preference is probably towards our food, but sentiment
retains the national diet. At the Japanese meals chopsticks are used.
The staple of these meals is rice.</p>

<p>In the way of liquids, our whisky-and-soda has now as great a vogue as
anything; but in all ships the national <i>saki</i> still abounds. This
is a light wine made from rice—a sort of cross between hock and thin
cider—disagreeable at first to most European palates, but for which one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
soon cultivates a liking. It is apt to play unexpected tricks on the
stranger who imbibes it too freely. In the winter time <i>saki</i> is
drunk warm.</p>

<p>Japanese tea is always “on tap.” It bears no resemblance to tea as we
know it, being a strong green tea made with water just off the boil.
Neither milk nor sugar is taken with it—sweets are, however, eaten
beforehand.</p>

<p>So far from these national drinks being in abeyance, if a visitor in a
Japanese warship elects to take one or the other in place of whisky or
champagne, it is taken as a compliment by his hosts.</p>

<p>Japanese sailors are fed entirely, or nearly so, on European food.
It was found that they could not work so well on Japanese diet, and
they prefer European. They cook it, however, in more or less Japanese
fashion, and always eat it with chopsticks.

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Guns.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
early Japanese warships were equipped with Krupp guns, the Naniwa
and Takachiho being so fitted. At a later date Canet guns were
introduced, but only for the heavy pieces, and the Matsushima class
carried a big 12.6 Canet and Elswick guns for the smaller pieces.
Subsequently, with the Fuji and Yashima, Elswick guns alone were
employed, and a factory for the construction of guns on the Elswick
model was established in Japan. The pieces selected were the 12-in.
40-calibre, the 8-in. 40-calibre, the 40-calibre 6-in., and the
45-calibre 4.7-in. Up to and including the Mikasa, all ships were
mounted with these guns.</p>

<p>In 1902-3 the Vickers 50-calibre 6-in. was experimented with and adopted.

<p>All guns of 40-calibres and over—that is to say, all the modern
pieces—fire a smokeless nitro-cellulose powder of Japanese invention,
and the maximum service velocities of all, save the 50-calibre Vickers,
are now up to the nominal initial velocity.</p>

<p>A.P. shot, A.P. shell, and common shell are fired by all guns, and, in
addition, those of 8 ins. or less calibre fire a special Japanese high
explosive of the lyddite type.</p>

<p>In smaller pieces, a 2½-pounder exists, which is to a certain extent a
Japanese invention; but it differs from models existing elsewhere only
in a few minor details of a semi-automatic nature. From what I have
seen of it, the piece would be better without these innovations.

Barr and Stroud range-finder is used in all Japanese ships, and
acted excellently at the bombardments of Port Arthur in February, 1904.</p>

<p>The Barr and Stroud transmitters are also fitted to all first-class
warships. By means of these the range, projectile, and so forth is
telegraphed from the conning-tower to a dial in each turret and
casement. Without some such device a range-finder is of no particular
service, as by the time the range is passed down it will have altered.</p>

<p>The Grenfell system of transmission is also understood to be under
experiment. This differs in details from the Barr and Stroud, but in
general principle is much the same thing.</p>

<p>The theoretical objection to the Barr and Stroud is that the electric
leads may be cut by a hostile shot. They might be, but as the wires
are carried in duplicate under the armour deck the chances of failure
are about one in a million! Throughout the war with Russia all these
instruments have worked perfectly, and proved particularly serviceable
in the bombardments of Port Arthur.

<p>This last torpedo has an effective range of over 3000 yards. It is not,
however, carried on shipboard.</p>

<p>The Whiteheads are identical with those in the British service. So,
too, are the above-water tubes. The submerged ones are of Elswick
pattern—Mark I., which was not satisfactory at high speeds in the
Fuji, Yashima, and Shikishima; Mark II., which delivers fairly well
at all speeds in the later ships. All ships that carry submerged
tubes—that is, all first-class battleships or cruisers—have four
fitted: two forward on the broadside and two bearing 45° abaft the
beam, just abaft the after barbette.</p>

<p>Above-water tubes are condemned, and several of those in existence were
under orders of removal when the Russian war broke out.</p>

<p>Above-water bow tubes were condemned on account of the seas that they
took in. As such as exist in armoured vessels are protected by 6-in.
armour, they did not improve seaworthiness, the weight in the extreme
bow being inconvenient.

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Armour.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">An</span>
armour-plate factory has been established at Kobé, but it is not yet
in a position to turn out much except gun shields.</p>

<p>A characteristic of the Japanese has been their readiness to adopt new
processes.</p>

<p>Thus the Fuji and Yashima were designed for compound armour, but the
Harvey process coming in while the ships were building, it was at once
adopted in preference to compound. So, too, in later ships the improved
Harvey, “Harvey-Nickel,” was at once used, and in the Iwate and Idzumo
belts were shortened a little and speed reduced, so that the Krupp
process might be employed for the water-line plates.</p>

<p>In the Mikasa great expense was undertaken solely in order to apply
Krupp cemented to curved surfaces instead of the non-cemented and less
tough Krupp plates usually so employed. There is some doubt whether
this experiment was successful; if Krupp cemented plates are “fiddled
with” their special virtue departs. It is also stated, however, that
the Mikasa’s plates were made on a special process somewhat analogous
to the Krupp, but differing from it in certain details, and less liable
to injury in bending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span></p>
<h3>5. <span class="smcap">Engines and Boilers.</span></h3>

<p>The engines of Japanese warships are, save in the case of a few small
vessels, of British manufacture, and the same as those of British ships.</p>

<p>In boilers, the Belleville type was adopted with the Shikishima, and
several older vessels have been re-boilered with it. Almost the first
warship to be fitted with this type was the Chiyoda.</p>

<p>With some remarkable exceptions, Japanese naval engineers have not
succeeded very conspicuously in securing the very economical coal
results which have been obtained with Bellevilles in the British Fleet.
A remarkable instance to the contrary was the Idzumo; the Mikasa also
did well. The Asahi, when first commissioned, did badly, but, when the
art of coal spreading on scientific lines was mastered, suddenly became
very economical.</p>

<p>No trouble of any sort has been experienced, and the Japanese have
shown themselves singularly adapted to the management of water-tube boilers.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span></p>

When the Yaeyama was re-boilered, Niclausse generators were fitted to
her, but with indifferent success. Consequently, in order to continue
experiments on the lines of the British Navy, this type was fitted to
the Niitaka and Tsushima, and ordered for one of the new battleships.
Apparently the experiment is to be continued to other types, following
the example of the British Navy, though the majority of the engineers
are averse to such a procedure, both on account of the success obtained
with the Belleville and because of the extreme difficulty involved when
many types exist, and many of the men sent to a ship are used to some
other type of boiler than the one that they are called on to work.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span>
A water-tube boiler of Japanese design exists—a species of cross
between the Belleville and Yarrow, with a little Niclausse thrown in.
It does not appear to promise well, and though designed to possess the
virtues of each type, seems more likely to embody their weaker points
than their strong ones. Such, at least, appears to be the general
verdict.</p>

<p>There is also another water-tube boiler of Japanese origin, something
like the Thornycroft, which is in the hands of the Temperley
Transported Company; but I have not heard of any practical tests of it
as yet, its invention being quite recent.</p>

<p>In any case, neither is likely to oust existing types, as most of the
valuable points in a boiler are already patented all over the world.
The inventors of new types are, therefore, hampered much like inventors
of new systems of wireless telegraphy are—some one has been before
them. In addition, a water-tube boiler requires some years of practical
service before it can be classed as out of the experimental stage. The
great advantage possessed by the Belleville, which “in theory” is one
of the worst of boilers, lies in the numerous features introduced by
years of practical experience. In rough-sea work theory and practice
rarely go together; the thing that is ideal on paper is apt at sea to fail
unexpectedly. The water-tube boilers fitted in Japanese ships are as follows:—

<p>The Japanese boiler under experiment is the Miyabara, the invention of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
the Engineer-in-Chief of the Japanese Navy. It is to be fitted to the
Otawa, and probably some other ships. It is also in the Hashidate. The
inventor recently produced a paper showing its all-round advantages
over every other type of water-tube boiler; but this, of course, may be
taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. However, there is little doubt but that,
should it be in any way successful, natural national vanity will lead
to its general adoption in preference to European types, just as the
2½-pounder gun has been.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br> OTHER NAVIES AS SEEN<br> BY THE JAPANESE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
following expressions of opinion are not necessarily entirely
representative, but they certainly coincide with the views of a great
many of the more travelled officers, and as such will have, no doubt,
some considerable interest.</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">British.</span></p>

<p>“British officers are too fond of golf and other games—they do not
study enough. They are very stiff at first, but nice when you know
them. They are always very clean, spick and span, and well shaved. On
board a British warship it is always very impressive—it is the most
impressive navy in the world. And it is more ready than many people think.”</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">French.</span></p>

<p>“The French is a funny navy, and it is hard to say what is good and
what is bad in it, for the thing that looks good may be bad, and the
thing that looks bad, good. They have some very clever engineers.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span></p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">German.</span></p>

<p>“The German officers all seem ‘strong.’ To many they seem always
overbearing. They hope to be the greatest navy in the world; and plenty
of them think that they already are.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap fs_120">Russian.</span><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>“The Russians are brave—very brave. But not many are good, and they
are savages. They can be very polite when it suits them; when not—ah!
Russian sailors are miserable people who lie in the snow, who have
very little money, which they spend in buying cheap fish. They are
very dirty. That is all we know of Russian sailors, who are quite like
strange people to us. But we have no fear as to the result of a war
with the Polar Bear.”</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">United States, America.</span></p>

<p>“The Americans have a wonderful navy with wonderful ships. Everything
American is more wonderful than anything else in the world, so that we
do not know what to believe.”</p>

<p class="f120"><span class="smcap">Themselves.</span></p>

<p>Of themselves Japanese officers speak little. But it is not difficult
to infer from their talk that they do not in any way feel dissatisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>
with themselves. Ship for ship, they are firmly convinced that they
are the finest navy in the world; and it cannot be said that up to the
moment of writing (June, 1904) they have done anything to cause them
to retract this opinion. No body of men could have displayed better
qualities than they have from all accounts. It may be added that, in my
opinion, every Japanese is also of conviction that Japan is going to be
the greatest naval power in the world in the future. With that feeling
they entered on the present war. It is a very useful feeling to have.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV<br> THE WAR WITH RUSSIA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
war with Russia was the direct outcome of the action of that Power
in ousting Japan from Port Arthur. There is little question but that
the real object of the Chino-Japanese War was Japan’s determination to
be the paramount power in the Far East. The action of Russia, France,
and Germany in neutralising all that victory gave her completely
checkmated Japan, and from that day onward she made little secret of
her preparations for a war, the prize of which would be the control
of China, and the foundation of a Far Eastern Empire whose ultimate
proportions none can foresee.</p>

<p>The political situation between Japan and Russia needs no comment
in a purely naval record of events: Japan made ready with a steady
determination, where Russia ignored the obvious.</p>

<p>Not till a month or two before the war did Russia recognise that it was
inevitable; she then sought refuge in diplomatic delays, which Japan
severed by the sudden rupture of negotiations at a moment favourable
to herself. Much has been written of Japan’s “treachery” and Russia’s
“duplicity,” but neither accusation is just.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span>
Following are the Japanese versions of the various incidents of the
war, as officially reported:—</p>

<p>They were prefaced by the Chemulpo incident, in which the Asama,
Naniwa, Takachiho, Suma, Chiyoda, and Niitaka annihilated the Russian
cruiser Variag and the gunboat Korietz.</p>

<p>As a naval incident, this action has little interest or significance,
the Russian ships being abnormally overmatched; indeed, there is
nothing in the affair worthy of comment save the admirable strategy
displayed by the Japanese in thus ensuring absolute victory without
taking any risks. A very high appreciation of the real meaning of
sea-power is evidenced here.</p>

<p>The rest of the naval war concentrated around Port Arthur. The Japanese
task was in no way an easy one, for Russia made no errors after the
first stupendous one by which she lost her two best battleships.</p>

<h3>FIRST ATTACK ON PORT ARTHUR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Admiral Togo’s</span>
official report of the attack on Port Arthur is dated
February 10, 1904, at sea, and is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>After the combined fleet left Sasebo on the 6th,
everything went off as planned.</p>

<p>At midnight, on the 8th, the advance squadron attacked
the enemy’s advance squadron, the latter being mostly
outside the bay.</p>

<p>The Poltava, Askold, and two others were apparently
struck by torpedoes.</p>

<p>At noon, on the 9th, the fleet advanced to the offing
of Port Arthur Bay, and attacked the enemy for forty
minutes, I believe doing considerable damage.</p>

<p>I believe the enemy were greatly demoralised. They
stopped fighting at one o’clock, and appeared to
retreat to the harbour.</p>

<p>The Japanese fleet suffered but very slight damage, and
its fighting strength has not decreased.</p>

<p>Our casualties were four killed and fifty-four wounded.
The imperial princes on board suffered no harm.</p>

<p>The conduct of the officers was cool, and not unlike
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span>
their conduct at manœuvres.</p>

<p>This morning, owing to the heavy south wind, detailed
reports from the vessels have not been received, so I
merely report the above facts.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Togo.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The ships actually torpedoed were the Tsarevitch, Retvizan, and
Pallada, none of which were sunk.</p>

<p>The Japanese fleet consisted of all the modern vessels.</p>

<p>The relative small loss inflicted upon the Russians is explained as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) Several of the Japanese boats followed some scouting Russian boats
in error.</p>

<p>(2) The torpedo is an uncertain weapon at the best.</p>
</div>

<p>The Japanese boats got in by imitating Russian signals.</p>

<p>In the battle of the 9th very little harm was done on either side. The
Novik and several other Russian ships were struck, but the damages were
in no case serious. On the Japanese side the Fuji and Iwate received some
hits, but these, though extensive, were not of a really serious nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span></p>

<h3>SECOND ATTACK</h3>

<p>The official report is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On the 13th a division of torpedo-boat destroyers started for
Port Arthur during a heavy snowstorm. The boats lost sight of each
other and became separated. Only the Hayatori and Asagiri reached
Port Arthur. The Asagiri sighted the entrance to the harbour at three
o’clock on the morning of the 14th, and was received with a heavy fire
by the batteries and scouting torpedo boats. She entered the harbour
and discharged a torpedo at a warship from whose funnel smoke was
ascending. The Asagiri then emerged safely, returning the fire of the
enemy’s torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>The same morning, at five o’clock, the Hayatori approached Port
Arthur and discerned two Russian ships, which opened fire on her. The
destroyer discharged a torpedo, which was seen to explode. The Hayatori
also escaped scathless.</p>

<p>It is impossible to state the definite material results, owing to
the darkness, but the moral effect was certainly considerable.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Togo.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It has not yet been definitely ascertained whether any Russian ship was
sunk; if so, it was only a minor vessel. This attack may be written off
as a wasted effort.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span></p>

<h3>ATTACK ON VLADIVOSTOK</h3>

<p>The next incident of note was the attack on Vladivostok,
which, again, was barren of results, as the
Russians did not attempt to reply.</p>

<p>The official report of the attack on Vladivostok,
from Admiral Kamimura, commanding the second
squadron, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>As prearranged, the squadron reached the eastern entrance of
Vladivostok on the morning of March 6, after passing through the frozen
sea. The enemy’s ships were not seen in the outside harbour, and the
Japanese vessels approached the batteries on the north-east coast from
a point beyond the range of the batteries of the Balzan Promontory and
the Bosphorous Strait.</p>

<p>After bombarding the inner harbour for forty minutes from ten
minutes to two, the Japanese squadron retired. It is believed that the
bombardment effected considerable damage. Soldiers were seen on land,
but the Russian batteries did not reply to the Japanese fire.</p>

<p>Black smoke was observed in the eastern entrance about five in the
afternoon, and was thought to be from the enemy’s ships, but the smoke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
gradually disappeared. On the morning of the 7th inst. the Japanese
squadron reconnoitred America Bay and Strelok Bay, but nothing unusual
was seen. The warships again approached the eastern entrance of
Vladivostok at noon, but the enemy’s ships were not visible, and the
batteries did not fire.</p>

<p>The squadron then turned towards Possiet Bay, but seeing nothing of
the enemy, retired.</p>
</div>

<p class="spa2">The next operations were more exciting, being officially reported as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>An attack on Port Arthur took place on March 10th, as previously
planned.</p>

<p>Our destroyers were formed into two separate flotillas. Both of
them reached the outside of the harbour at midnight on the 9th and
reconnoitred, but no enemy was seen. At dawn the second flotilla laid
special mechanical mines in many places, and succeeded in the task,
notwithstanding the intermittent fires from the enemy’s forts.</p>

<p>At half-past four a.m. the first flotilla encountered six Russian
destroyers at the south of Liaotishan, and a hot action took place for
twenty minutes. In its course three of our destroyers—Asashio, Kasumi,
and Akatsuki—fought very closely against the enemy’s destroyers, almost
touching each other, and delivered a hot fire.</p>

<p>The enemy’s destroyers were severely injured, either being damaged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span>
in engines or suffering from the outbreak of fire, and fled away in
great confusion. Our ships also sustained some damage. Casualties on
our side are seven petty officers killed and nine men wounded.</p>

<p>The Akatsuki’s auxiliary steampipe was destroyed, but all the
destroyers of the first flotilla have no difficulty for further
fighting or navigation.</p>

<p>The second flotilla, when it was leaving the outside of the harbour
at 7 a.m., found two Russian destroyers just coming back into the
harbour, and attacked them, intercepting their return course. One of
the two escaped, but the other—namely, the Steregutchy—was destroyed
and captured by our destroyer Sazanami, which tried to tow it back.
However, the leakage was great and the sea very rough, and the
towing-rope was broken. Therefore, after the prisoners, four in all,
were taken up, the captured ship was left, and she sank at ten minutes
past ten a.m.</p>

<p>The damage in the second flotilla is insignificant. Casualties: Two
men killed and one officer and three men wounded.</p>

<p>Although the Novik and Bayan came out from the harbour towards the
second flotilla, they soon retired into the harbour upon seeing that
our cruisers were approaching.</p>

<p>As to the movements of our main squadron and the cruiser squadron,
they arrived off Port Arthur at eight a.m. The cruiser squadron at once
proceeded towards the front of the mouth of the harbour and supported
our destroyer flotilla, as above stated.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>The main squadron also approached Liaotishan, from ten a.m. until
twenty minutes to two p.m., and made an indirect bombardment
against the harbour. The enemy’s forts intermittently returned the
fire, but no damage was inflicted upon our ships. A detached squadron
of cruisers went to Dalny, and destroyed the enemy’s buildings on the
San Shan Islands.</p>

<p>The Takasago and Chihaya scouted the western coast of the entrance
of Port Arthur, but no enemy was seen.</p>

<p>A Russian destroyer, which had been sunk in Pigeon Bay in the
last battle, is found to be the Vnushitelni, of which now the upper
parts of the masts and funnels are seen on the surface. All our ships
discontinued the battle at two p.m., and retired.</p>
</div>

<p class="spa2">Subsequently an attempt was made to block Port Arthur
harbour with sunken ships. It was also hoped to destroy the Retvizan by
exploding ships near her, but the attack was completely foiled by the
defence.</p>

<p>There was a second bottling expedition of March 27th, which again
failed. It led to the death of a valuable officer, Commander Hirose.
The official report ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The united squadron again left for Port Arthur on Saturday.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning at half-past three it commenced blockading
the harbour entrance. The four steamers to be sunk, escorted by a
flotilla of destroyers, advanced to the entrance, facing the enemy’s
searchlights.</p>

<p>At about two miles from the entrance they were discovered by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[Pg 352]</span>
enemy, and exposed to fire from the fortress on either shore, and also
from the enemy’s ships on guard.</p>

<p>Braving these dangers, the four steamers ran into the waterway
at the mouth of the harbour. The Chiyo-maru anchored at about half
a chain from the shore, to the west of Golden Hill, and blew up.
The Fukui-maru, passing to the left of Chiyo-maru, advanced a short
distance, and was about to anchor, when she was struck by a torpedo
from the enemy’s destroyers, and sank. The Yahiko-maru went to the left
of the Fukui-maru, and blew up herself.</p>

<p>The Yoneyama-maru reached the harbour entrance, and colliding
against the stern of an enemy’s destroyer, managed to reach the middle
passage by passing between the Chiyo-maru and Fukui-maru. Just at that
moment an enemy’s torpedo struck and sunk her. The momentum brought her
forward to the left shore, and with her bows towards the left side sank
sideways.</p>

<p>To have accomplished the work so far under such great disadvantages
and dangers must be considered a success and command admiration. It
is regrettable, however, that, owing to some space being still left
between the Yahiko-maru and Yoneyama-maru, a complete blocking has not
been effected.</p>

<p>Those who were engaged in this work are those who had been engaged
in the same work before. It was by their special request that only the
petty officers and crews were supplanted by new men.</p>

<p>The casualties were as follows:—Commander Hirose and three petty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>
officers killed; Lieut. Shimada mortally wounded; Lieut. Masuki,
Engineer Kura, and six petty officers and men slightly wounded. All the
rest of the crews were safely picked up by our destroyers.</p>

<p>Commander Hirose and Boatswain Sugino, who were killed, displayed
admirable courage. Sugino was just going down to light the magazine
on the Fukui-maru, when the ship was struck by the enemy’s torpedo,
killing him. Commander Hirose, after causing his men to take to the
boats, and not finding Sugino, searched through the ship three times.
Finding his ship gradually going down, he was compelled to leave her
and enter the boat. As the boat was rowing away under the enemy’s fire,
a shell struck him on the head, and the greater part of his body was
blown away, the only remaining part of this brave officer’s body being
a piece of flesh in the boat.</p>

<p>Commander Hirose was always a model officer, and he leaves a
meritorious example and memory which will be everlasting.</p>

<p>For the protection of the steamers and the rescue of their crews,
all our flotilla of destroyers did their utmost, in the face of
the enemy’s severe cannonade. Above all, the destroyers Kotaka and
Tsubame penetrated to within a mile of the harbour entrance, where
they encountered and engaged an enemy’s destroyer, to which they did
considerable damage. The Russian destroyer seemed to have had her
boiler hit, and sent up a volume of steam, and retreated.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>As the officers and men were leaving the harbour after their work
was done, they observed one of the enemy’s ships below Golden Hill. She
seemed completely disabled.</p>

<p>In spite of the enemy’s very hot fire, to which our flotilla was
exposed until dawn, no damage whatever was sustained.</p>

<p>The crews on board the Chiyo-maru and Yahi-maru were taken on board
the destroyer Tsubame. The crew of the Yoneyama-maru escaped in three
boats, and were rescued by the destroyers Misasagi and Karigane. The
crew of the Fukui-maru was taken on board the Kasumi.</p>

<p>The following torpedo boats and destroyers took part in the
engagement:—</p>

<p>Destroyers.—Shirakumo, Kasumi, Asashio, Akatsuki, Akebono, Oboro,
Inazumi, Ikadzuchi, Usugumo, Sazanami, and Shimonome.</p>

<p>Torpedo boats.—Karigane, Kotaka, Misasagi, Tsubame, Managure, and
Hato.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Togo.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="spa2">The concluding operation of the first stage of the war
was reported as follows by Admiral Togo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On the 11th our combined fleet commenced, as previously planned,
the eighth attack upon Port Arthur. The fourth and the fifth destroyer
flotillas, the fourteenth torpedo flotilla, and the Koryo-maru reached
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[Pg 355]</span>
the mouth of Port Arthur at midnight of the 12th, and effected the
laying of mines at several points outside the port, defying the enemy’s
searchlight.</p>

<p>The second destroyer flotilla discovered, at dawn of the 13th, one
Russian destroyer trying to enter the harbour, and, after ten minutes’
attack, sank her.</p>

<p>Another Russian destroyer was discovered coming from the direction
of Liau-tie-shan. We attacked her, but she managed to flee into the
harbour.</p>

<p>There were no casualties on our side, except two seamen in the
Ikazuchi slightly wounded. There was no time to rescue the enemy’s
drowning crew, as the Bayan approached.</p>

<p>The third fleet reached outside of Port Arthur at 8 a.m., when the
Bayan came out and opened fire. Immediately the Novik, Askold, Diana,
Petropavlovsk, Pobieda, and Poltava came out and made offensive attack
upon us.</p>

<p>Our third fleet, tardily answering and gradually retiring, enticed
the enemy fifteen miles south-east of the port, when our first fleet,
being informed through wireless telegraphy from the third fleet,
suddenly appeared before the enemy and attacked them.</p>

<p>While the enemy was trying to regain the port, a battleship of the
Petropavlovsk type struck mines laid by us in the previous evening, and
sank at 10.32 a.m.</p>

<p>Another ship was observed to have lost freedom of movement, but the
confusion of enemy’s ships prevented us from identifying her. They
finally managed to regain the port.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>Our third fleet suffered no damage. The enemy’s damage was, besides
the above-mentioned, probably slight also.</p>

<p>Our first fleet did not reach firing distance. Our fleets retired at
1 p.m., prepared for another attack</p>

<p>On the 14th our fleet resailed towards Port Arthur. The second,
the fourth, and the fifth destroyer flotillas and the ninth torpedo
flotilla joined at 3 a.m., and the third fleet at 7 a.m. No enemy’s
ship was seen outside the port.</p>

<p>Our first fleet arrived there at 9 a.m., and, discovering three
mines laid by the enemy, destroyed them all.</p>

<p>The Kasuga and the Nisshin were despatched to the west of
Liau-tie-shan. They made an indirect bombardment for two hours, this
being their first action. The new forts at Liau-tie-shan were finally
silenced.</p>

<p>Our forces retired at 1.30 p.m.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Togo.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="spa2">The Russian ship destroyed was Admiral Makaroff’s
flagship, the Petropavlovsk; the second ship injured was the battleship
Pobieda. In the action in which she engaged the third squadron, the
Bayan also was damaged, and the effective Russian fleet for the moment
reduced to the Peresviet, Sevastopol, Askold, Diana, Novik, and some
five destroyers.</p>

<p>Another attempt to block the harbour followed, no less than ten ships
being employed. In Japan this attempt was accepted as completely
successful; but there are few grounds for believing that it was more
than temporarily so.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span></p>

<p>Too little is yet known of the real facts of the war for many
conclusions of value to be drawn; indeed, only one thing is as yet
fully clear, and that is the importance of battleships. Russia’s
failure lay here. Lacking a battleship superiority, she was unable to
support her cruisers, and these consequently unable to support the
destroyers. As a result, despite the extraordinary activity of the
Russian cruiser Bayan, the naval war followed the exact course that any
one cognizant of naval affairs could have predicted on February 10,
1904. Only the battleship can confer command of the sea.</p>

<p>Later events to the end of May included the loss of the battleship
Hatsuse, by contact with a Russian mine, and the sinking of the cruiser
Yoshino, after collision with the Kasuga in a fog.

<h3>THE SINKING OF THE<br> KOW-SHING</h3>
</div>

<p class="center spb1"><b><span class="smcap">Official Report of Captain Togo
of the Naniwa</span></b></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap"><span class="fs_80">“</span>At</span>
9.15 a.m., coming close to the Kow-shing, I signalled J. W. (to
stop immediately) and twice fired blank shot. The next signal was L.
P. (to anchor), which she obeyed. I was at that time very anxious to
catch the flying Chinese warship, and I turned a little while in that
direction. At that time the Kow-shing signalled D. N. W. R. (may I
proceed), which I answered by the signal J. W.</p>

<p>“At 10.40, I sent Lieutenant Hitomi and others as prize officers to
her. On seeing all the papers and other things, they found that she
was carrying contraband persons. So I ordered her to follow me, which
her captain consented to do. When I hoisted the signal L. R. (slip or
weigh anchor immediately), she asked me by signal to send a boat for
communication. I thought that the captain wished to tell me that he was
prevented by the Chinese soldiers from obeying my order. So I ordered
Lieutenant Hitomi to go again to her, giving him instructions to
bring the Europeans on board the Naniwa, if the Chinese generals were
resisting the carrying out of my order. When the lieutenant came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>
alongside, the captain came to the gangway and said that the Chinese
generals asked to be allowed to return to Taku, as they did not know
that war had broken out. The lieutenant informed me that, when he
went there, the Chinese soldiers were in a condition of the greatest
confusion and excitement, so that the captain intentionally came down
to the gangway and would not let him go on deck. Four hours had been
consumed in these fruitless negotiations, and there was no longer room
for hesitation, so I signalled M. L. (quit the ship immediately). To
this the captain again answered by the signal demanding a boat. At that
time I thought it would be rather foolish to send our officers, as the
Chinese were in such an excited state. Accordingly I signalled H. J.
(boat cannot come). It seemed to me that she was awaiting the arrival
of the Chinese fleet; moreover, it was very dangerous to hesitate any
longer, so I again hoisted the signal M. L., and at the same time a red
flag on the foremast. At 1.10 p.m. I ordered one torpedo and shells to
be discharged. The latter hit the engine-room.</p>

<p>“At 1.15 the Kow-shing began to sink from her stern.</p>

<p>“At 1.37 I sent two cutters to rescue the captain, the officers and the
rest.</p>

<p>“At 1.46 she sank.</p>

<p>“The spot where she sank is two miles south of the island of
Sho-pai-oul.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p class="center spb1 spa1"><b><span class="smcap">Captain Galsworthy’s
Report.</span></b></p>

<p>The British steamer Kow-shing, owned by the Indo-China Co., left
Shang-hai on July 17th, bound to Taku, under charter to carry Chinese
troops from that port to Asan, on the coast of Korea. Arriving at Taku
on the 20th, arrangements were made to ship the troops, and on the 23rd
1100 came on board, including two generals, a number of other officers
of various ranks, and a German ex-army officer named Hanneken, who came
as an ordinary passenger. At 9.50 p.m. on the 23rd the ship proceeded
on her voyage to Asan. All went well until the morning of the 25th,
when off Shopeiul Island, we passed a man-of-war flying the Japanese
naval ensign, with a white flag above it. This vessel proved to be the
Chinese warship Tei-yuen. Shortly afterwards we sighted three Japanese
men-of-war, the Naniwa, Yoshino, and another (probably the Akitsushiu).
The Naniwa at once steamed towards us, flying a signal ordering us to
stop. She also fired two blank charges, and signalled us to anchor,
which we did at once. The Naniwa then steamed away, apparently to
communicate with the other ships. I at once enquired by signal if I
might proceed, to which the Naniwa replied, “Heave-to or take the
consequences.” A boat then came from the Naniwa and an officer came on
board. He was received at the gangway, and he asked to see the ship’s
papers. They were shown him, and his attention particularly called to
the fact that she was a British ship. Numerous other questions were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
asked and answered, the most important one being, “Would the Kow-shing
follow the Naniwa?” Being utterly helpless against a man-of-war, I
replied that there would be no alternative but to do so, under protest,
if ordered. The officer then left the ship, and proceeded to the
Naniwa. Shortly after, being still at anchor, I was ordered by signal
to cut, slip, or weigh immediately. The Chinese generals learning
the meaning of the signals, and finding preparations were being made
to follow the Naniwa, objected most emphatically. They were told how
useless it would be to resist, as one shot would sink them in a short
time. The generals then said they would rather die than obey Japanese
orders, and, as they had 1100 men against about 400 on the Naniwa, they
would fight sooner than surrender. They were told that if they decided
to fight, the foreign officers would leave the ship. The generals then
gave orders to the troops on deck to kill us if we obeyed the orders
of the Japanese or attempted to leave the ship. With gestures they
threatened to cut off our heads, to stab or shoot us; and a lot of men
were selected to watch us and carry out the order. A signal was then
made requesting the Naniwa to send a boat, in order to communicate
the state of affairs. A boat was at once sent, but a crowd of armed
Chinese took possession of the gangway, until I prevailed on the
generals to send them away. Eventually the officers came alongside, and
a message for the commander of the Naniwa was sent, stating that the
Chinese refused to allow the Kow-shing to be taken, and insisting upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
returning to Taku. It was again pointed out that she was a British
ship, and that she had left port before war had been declared. The boat
then returned to the Naniwa, and on her arrival a signal was hoisted
ordering the Europeans to leave the ship at once. A reply was given
that they were not allowed to leave the ship, and asking for a boat to
be sent. Notice was sent to the engineers to be handy on deck in case
the Japanese fired. The Naniwa shortly afterwards replied that a boat
could not be sent. The Naniwa then hoisted a red flag at the fore,
which was apparently a signal for discharging a torpedo, as one was
fired at the Kow-shing, but missed her. A broadside of five guns was
then fired. At the time I was on the bridge, my officers having left
it, and seeing that the soldiers set to watch me had left their station
at the foot of the ladder, I rushed to the wheelhouse, and, after
obtaining a lifebelt (the last one remaining), I jumped over the ship’s
side. In doing so I heard a terrific explosion, and upon returning to
the surface of the sea I found the atmosphere was thick with smoke and
fine coal-powder. I at once struck out for the shore, distant about
1¼ miles. There were many Chinese in the water, but I only saw one
European, Mr. von Hanneken. As the air cleared, a bullet struck the
water close to my ear, and was followed by a shower of bullets. Knowing
that shot from the Naniwa could not strike near me, owing to being
sheltered by the hull of the Kow-shing, I turned on my back, and saw
the Chinese soldiers firing at me from the deck and the ’tween deck
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>
ports. As far as possible I protected the back of my head with the
lifebelt, and swam as low in the water as I could. Shortly after the
Kow-shing went down, stern first. After being in the water some time,
I was picked up by the Naniwa’s cutter, in a very exhausted condition.
The same boat had already rescued one of the quartermasters, who had
been wounded in the neck by a rifle bullet. On arriving at the Naniwa
we found that the chief officer was the only other person saved by
the Japanese, leaving five Europeans connected with the ship, and the
passenger, missing. We anchored off Shopeiul about 9 a.m. The firing
commenced about 1 p.m., and we were taken aboard the Naniwa about 2.30
p.m. During the evening the Naniwa steamed away, arriving the next
morning at the rendezvous of the Japanese Fleet in Korea. We were then
transferred to the Yayeyama, together with a Danish electrician, named
Muhlenstedt, and about sixty Chinese, who were taken prisoners from the
Chinese steamer Tso-kiang, the same clay. The Yayeyama then proceeded
to Sasebo, arriving on the morning of the 28th. From Sasebo I and Mr.
Tamplin, the chief officer, came here in a small tender at noon on
Sunday last, having in the mean time been interviewed by Mr. Suyematsu
Kencho, President of the Imperial Board of Legislature, who came down
from Tokyo for that purpose. The quartermaster remained behind owing
to his wound not having properly healed up, whilst Mr. Muhlenstedt is
being further detained. During our detention we received every care and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
attention necessary for our comfort. After arriving here we proceeded
to H.M.’s Consulate, and made an affidavit of the entire circumstances.
The Naniwa, I may mention, had been damaged on the port quarter from a
shot fired from the Tche-yuen in the morning. I can positively say I
did not see the Japanese fire on the Chinese in the water. The Chinese
killed many of their own people.

<h3>LOSS OF THE KOW-SHING</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Finding</span>
and Order of a Naval Court, held at H.B.M. Consulate, Nagasaki,
on August 7, 1894.</p>

<p>The S.S. Kow-shing was an iron vessel, schooner rigged, of 1355 tons
registered tonnage, official number 87000, built at Barrow-in-Furness,
and belonging to the port of London. It appears from evidence given
before this court that she sailed from Taku on or about the 23rd day of
July, 1894, bound for Gasan, in Korea, with no cargo but 1100 Chinese
troops on board, that everything went well until the morning of the
25th July, when about 9 a.m. the Naniwa-kan, a Japanese man-of-war,
signalled to her to stop and to anchor, with the island of Sho-pei-oul
bearing about N. by E., distant 1¼ miles. That after communicating
with the Kow-shing twice by boat, and ordering the officers to quit
the vessel, which they were prevented doing by the Chinese troops, the
Naniwa-kan, about 1 p.m., discharged a torpedo at the Kow-shing, and
this not striking her the Naniwa-kan fired a broadside of five heavy
guns at her and continued firing both heavy and machine guns from
deck and tops until she sank, about an hour later. That when firing
commenced a number of the crew and Chinese troops jumped overboard,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
amongst them the master, Thomas Ryder Galsworthy, the first mate, Lewis
Henry Tamplin, and a quartermaster, Lucas Evangelista (a Manilla man),
who are the only members of the crew at present known to be saved.
The court, having regard to the circumstances above stated, find as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. That the ship was sufficiently seaworthy and found well in all
necessary respects.</p>

<p>2. That the conduct of the officers and crew before and up to the
time of the sinking of the vessel was satisfactory and free from
blame.</p>

<p>3. That the cause of the sinking was due to her having been
repeatedly struck by heavy cannon shots from the Naniwa-kan, a Japanese
man-of-war.</p>

<p>4. That no efforts on the part of the master or crew would have
availed to avert the catastrophe.</p>

<p>5. That the court attaches no blame whatever to the master, Thomas
Ryder Galsworthy, or any of the officers or crew.</p>

<p>6. The expenses of the Court are merely approved.</p>

ascends that stream to the mouth of the River Anping; from thence
the line runs to Funghwang; from thence to Haiching, from thence to
Yingkow, forming a line which describes the southern portion of the
territory. The places above named are included in the ceded territory.
When the line reaches the River Liao at Yingkow it follows the course
of that stream to its mouth, where it terminates. The mid-channel of
the River Liao shall be taken as the line of demarcation.</p>

<p>The cession also includes all islands appertaining or belonging to the
province of Fêng-Tien situated in the eastern portion of the bay of
Liaotung and in the northern part of the Yellow Sea.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Island of Formosa, together with all islands
appertaining or belonging to the said Island of Formosa.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Pescadores Group, that is to say, all islands lying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[Pg 374]</span>
between the 119th and 120th degrees of longitude east of Greenwich and
the 23rd and 24th degrees of north latitude.</p>
</div>

<p>Art. 3. The alignments of the frontiers described in the preceding
article shall be subject to verification and demarcation on the
spot, by a joint commission of delimitation consisting of two or
more Japanese and two or more Chinese delegates to be appointed
immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of this act. In
case the boundaries laid down in this act are found to be defective
at any point, either on account of topography or in consideration of
good administration, it shall also be the duty of the delimitation
commission to rectify the same.</p>

<p>The delimitation commission will enter upon its duties as soon as
possible, and will bring its labours to a conclusion within the period
of one year after appointment.</p>

<p>The alignments laid down in this act shall, however, be maintained
until the rectifications of the delimitation commission, if any are made,
shall have received the approval of the governments of Japan and China.</p>

<p>Art. 4. China agrees to pay to Japan as a war indemnity the sum of
200,000,000 Kuping Taels. The said sum to be paid in eight instalments.
The first instalment of 50,000,000 taels to be paid within six months,
and the second instalment of 50,000,000 taels to be paid within twelve
months, after the exchange of the ratifications of this act. The
remaining sum to be paid in six equal annual instalments, as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[Pg 375]</span>
The first of such equal annual instalments to be paid within two
years; the second within three years; the third within four years; the
fourth within five years; the fifth within six years, and the sixth
within seven years, after the exchange of the ratification of this
act. Interest at the rate of 5 per centum per annum shall begin to run
on all unpaid portions of the said indemnity from the date the first
instalment falls due.</p>

<p>China shall, however, have the right to pay by anticipation at any
time any or all of the said instalments. In case the whole amount of
the indemnity is paid within three years after the exchange of the
ratification of the present act, all interest shall be waived and
the interest for two years and a half or for any less period if then
already paid shall be included as a part of the principal amount of the
indemnity.</p>

<p>Art. 5. The inhabitants of the territories ceded to Japan, who wish
to take up their residence outside the ceded districts, shall be at
liberty to sell their real property and retire. For this purpose a
period of two years from the date of the exchange of the ratifications
of the present act shall be granted. At the expiration of that period
those of the inhabitants who shall not have left such territories
shall, at the option of Japan, be deemed to be Japanese subjects.</p>

<p>Each of the two governments shall, immediately upon the exchange of
the ratifications of the present act, send one or more commissioners
to Formosa to effect a final transfer of that province; and within the
space of two months after the exchange of the ratifications of this act
such transfer shall be completed.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span></p>

<p>Art. 6. All treaties between Japan and China having come to an end in
consequence of the war, China engages, immediately upon the exchange

conclude, with the Japanese plenipotentiaries, a treaty of commerce and
navigation and a convention to regulate frontier intercourse and trade.
The treaties, conventions and regulations now subsisting between China
and European powers shall serve as a basis for the said treaty and
convention between Japan and China. From the date of the exchange of
the ratifications of this act until the said treaty and convention are

commerce; navigation; frontier intercourse and trade; industries; ships
and subjects, shall, in every respect, be accorded by China the most
favoured nation treatment.</p>

<p>China makes in addition the following concession, to take effect six
months after the date of the present act:</p>

<p>1st.—The following cities, towns and ports, in addition to those

<h3>CORRESPONDENCE IN CONNECTION WITH<br> THE WEI-HAI-WEI SURRENDER.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="fs_80">“</span><span class="smcap">HONOURED SIR,</span><br>
<span class="ws2">&nbsp;</span>“An unfortunate turn of events has made
us enemies: but as the warfare of to-day does not imply animosity
between each and all individuals, we hope our former friendship is
still warm enough to assure Your Excellency that these lines, which
we address to you with your kind permission, are dictated by a motive
higher than that of a mere challenge to surrender. This motive is that
of submitting to the calm consideration of a friend a reason for an
action which seems to be truly conducive to the good of his country
and of himself, although stress of circumstances might temporarily
conceal this from him. To whatever cause the successive failures of
Chinese arms on both sea and land may be attributed, we think Your
Excellency’s sound judgement will not fail in assigning them to their
true cause, which must be apparent to any unprejudiced observer. In
China the literary class is still the governing section, and literary
accomplishment is the chief if not the sole way to rank and power now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span>
as it was a thousand years ago. We do not venture to deny that this
system is excellent in well be permanent and sufficient if China were
to stand alone in the world. But national isolation is no longer a
possibility. Your Excellency must know what a hard experience the
Japanese empire had thirty years ago, and how narrowly she escaped the
awful calamity which threatened. To throw away the old principle and
to adopt the new, as the sole condition of preserving the integrity
of your empire, is as necessary with your government now as it was
with ours. The necessity must be attended to, or fall is inevitable
sooner or later. That the crisis is being brought about by the Japanese
arms is mere chance. It might have been caused by other political
difficulties, which are equally destructive. Now at such a juncture
is it the part of a truly patriotic man, upon whom the necessity of
action devolves, to allow himself to be simply dragged along by force
of circumstances? Compared with the re-establishment on a sound working
basis of the oldest empire in the world, with its glorious history and
its extensive territories, what is the surrender of a fleet or the loss
of a whole army? If Your Excellency be truly patriotic and loyal to the
cause of your country, we beg you to listen to the words of sympathetic
hearts filled with the sense of honour representative of the fighting
men of Japan; words which ask you to come and stay in Japan until the
time arrives when your services shall be required for the good cause.
Not to speak of the numerous instances of final success after temporary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[Pg 383]</span>
humiliation in your own history of the ancient dynasties, let me call
your attention to the case of the French Marshal Macmahon, who allowed
himself to be detained in the enemy’s land till it was expedient that
he should return and aid in reforming the government, which instead
of dishonouring him raised him to the presidency: or to the case of
Osman Pasha whom the unfortunate event of Plevna did not prevent
from subsequently filling the post of minister of war and rendering
important services in reforming the army. As to the way in which
Your Excellency may be received in Japan, let us assure you of the
magnanimity of our sovereign. His Majesty not only pardoned his own
subjects who fought against the imperial side, but even raised them
to important positions according to their personal merits, as in the
case of Admiral Enomoto, Privy Councillor Otori, and others. Surely
he would be more magnanimous to one who is not his own subject, and
whose glorious career is so well known to the world. The great problem
with Your Excellency now is whether to submit to the great calamity
which must be the inevitable consequence of further adherence to the
old principle, or to survive it for the sake of future reform. We know
it is the custom of your officials to meet any communication from an
opponent with a pride designed to show consciousness of strength or
to conceal weakness, but we hope Your Excellency will understand that
the present communication is not made without due consideration of
the vast interests at stake, but that it is the outcome of the truest
sincerity and of feelings which should lead to the realisation of those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[Pg 384]</span>
interests, and we hope you will kindly consider it in that light.</p>

<p>“Should the present communication meet with your approval, the carrying
out of its import will, with Your Excellency’s permission, be arranged
through further communications, and we have the honour to be, etc., etc.</p>

<h3>THE PROPOSAL TO SURRENDER</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="fs_80">“</span><span class="smcap">I, TING,</span>
commander-in-chief of the Pei-yang squadron, acknowledge having
previously received a letter from Vice-Admiral Ito, commander of the
port of Sasebo. This letter I have not answered until to-day, owing to
the hostilities going on between our fleets. It had been my intention
to continue fighting until every one of my men-of-war was sunk and
the last sailor killed; but I have reconsidered the matter and now
request a truce, hoping thereby to save many lives. I earnestly beseech
you to refrain from doing further hurt to the Chinese and Westerners
serving in the army and navy of China, as well as to the townspeople of
Wei-hai-wei; in return for which I offer to surrender to the empire of
Japan all my men-of-war, the forts on Liu-kung-tau and all material of
war in and about Wei-hai-wei. If Vice-Admiral Ito will accede to these
terms, I desire to have the commander-in-chief of the British warships
in the offing as a guarantor of the contract. Requesting an answer to
this by to-morrow, I have the honour to remain, etc.</p>

Accordingly I shall take over all the men-of-war, the forts and all
warlike material from your hands. As to the time when the surrender
is to take place, I will consult you again on receiving your reply to
this. My idea is, after taking over everything, to escort you and the
others referred to in your letter on board one of our warships to some
safe place where your convenience may be suited. If I may be permitted
to speak quite frankly, I advise you for your own and your country’s
sake to remain in Japan until the war is over. Should you decide to
come to my country you may rest assured that you will be treated with
distinguished consideration. But if you desire to return to your native
land I shall of course put no obstacle in your path. As for any British
guarantee, I think it quite unnecessary, and trust in your honour as
an officer and a gallant man. Requesting your reply to this by 10 a.m.
to-morrow, I have the honour to remain, etc.</p>

brought over the said letter, I received with great personal regret.</p>

is that some responsible Chinese officer should come over to this
our flagship Matsushima before 6 o’clock p.m. this day, the 13th of
February according to the Japanese year, and we will then make certain

over of the said vessels, forts and other materials of war, as well

conditions have to be arranged with some one who can deal with us in
his stead.</p>

<h3>THE CONVENTION OF SURRENDER</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Towards</span>
7 p.m. of 13th February Tao-tai Niu Chang-Ping, accompanied by
Captain Ching, came under a white flag to the Matsushima. He introduced
himself as the representative of the naval and military forces at
Wei-hai-wei. Admiral Ito then proposed to him several conditions
relating to the vessels, forts and materials of war, the escorting of
the Chinese and foreign officers and men out of Wei-hai-wei, and so
forth. After a consultation of several hours Tao-tai Niu and Captain
Ching left the ship, arranging to come back before 2 p.m. on the 14th.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m. on the 14th, Tao-tai Niu, the Chinese plenipotentiary, came
again under a white flag, accompanied by Captain Ching, and after
further consultation the following terms were agreed upon between the
two parties as conditions of capitulation, and the English version of
them, which was to serve as the original text, was signed by Admiral
Ito and Tao-tai Niu.</p>

<p>Art. I. That a list of the names, functions, and ranks of all the
naval and military officers, both Chinese and foreign, required to
be transported in safety, should be produced. For foreigners, their
nationalities should also be mentioned. As to soldiers, clerks, etc.,
only their numbers are to be given.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span></p>

<p>Art. II. That all the naval and military officers, both Chinese and
foreign, should pledge themselves by a formal declaration in writing
that they will not re-engage themselves in the present war between
Japan and China.</p>

<p>Art. III. That all the weapons, powder, and projectiles for use of
land forces on the Island of Liu-kung-tau should be collected in fixed
places, and these places made known to us. The soldiers of the said
land forces shall be landed at Chiu-tau, and from thence they are to
be conducted by Japanese guards to the outposts of the Japanese army
now occupying the localities around Wei-hai-wei. The landing is to
begin from 5 o’clock p.m. on the 14th of February, 1895 (20th January,
Chinese calendar), and end before noon on the 15th February, 1895 (21st
January of the Chinese calendar).</p>

<p>Art. IV. That Tao-tai Niu, representing the Chinese naval and military
forces at Wei-hai-wei as plenipotentiary, should appoint a suitable
number of committees, for the delivery of the vessels and forts. These
committees are required to send in before noon, February 15th, 1895, a
list of the vessels and forts in their charge with the number and kinds
of the guns, rifles, and other weapons now contained in these vessels
or forts.</p>

<p>Art. V. That the Chinese naval and military officers and men, native
and foreign, should be allowed to leave Wei-hai-wei after noon on the
16th of February, 1895 (22nd of January of the Chinese calendar), in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
steamship Kwang-Chi, sailing out of the harbour under the condition
stipulated in Art. X.</p>

<p>Art. VI. That the Chinese naval and military officers, both native and
foreign, should be allowed to take with them their personal movable
property only, with the exception of arms, which are to be delivered up
even if they be private property. Whenever deemed necessary the things
they take away shall be submitted to inspection.</p>

<p>Art. VII. That the permanent residents, <i>i.e.</i> the original
inhabitants of the Island of Liu-kung-tau, should be persuaded to
continue their abode on the island.</p>

<p>Art. VIII. That the landing of the requisite number of the Japanese
officers and men, on the Island of Liu-kung-tau, in order to take
possession of the forts and materials of war on the island, should
commence from 9 o’clock a.m. on the 16th of February, 1895 (22nd of
January by Chinese calendar), but that Admiral Ito reserves to himself
the right of sending a certain number of the Japanese men-of-war into
the harbour, whenever the necessity occurs at any time after the
signing of the present stipulations.</p>

<p>The naval officers, both native and foreign, on board the Chinese
vessels may remain therein until 9 o’clock a.m. on the 16th February,
1895 (22nd January of Chinese calendar). Those marines, seamen, etc.,
on board the same vessels who wish to be escorted out of Wei-hai-wei by
land should be landed in the same place and escorted in the same way as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span>
the soldiers of the land forces, the landing to begin from noon on the
15th of February (21st January of Chinese calendar), that is to say
after the landing of the soldiers of the land forces is finished.</p>

<p>Art. IX. That women, children, aged persons and other non-combatants
who wish to leave the Island of Liu-kung-tau should be allowed to sail
out of either the eastern or western mouth of the harbour in Chinese
junks any time after the morning of the 15th of February, 1895 (21st
January of the Chinese calendar). These vessels are, however, to be
examined by the Japanese naval officers and men in the torpedo boats
or the other boats posted at the mouth of the harbour, the examination
extending to both persons and baggage.</p>

<p>Art. X. That the coffins of the lamented Admiral Ting and the officers
next to him should be allowed to be carried out of the harbour after
noon on the 16th of February, 1895 (22nd of January of the Chinese
calendar), and before noon on the 23rd of February, 1895 (29th January
of the Chinese calendar), in the steamer Kwang-chi, which Admiral Ito
refrains from taking possession of and lays at the disposal of Tao-tai
Niu as representing the Chinese navy and army at Wei-hai-wei, solely
out of respect to the memory of Admiral Ting, who did his duty towards

<h2 class="nobreak">JAPANESE SHIP-NAMES</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span>
names of a few Japanese ships are singularly beautiful and poetical
in their meanings; the majority, however, have little significance. As
the meanings of Japanese ship-names are not given in Captain Prince
Louis of Battenberg's interesting “Men-of-War Names,” a glossary of
them is here inserted for reference and information.</p>

<p>All names with the prefix <i>Chin</i> (Chinese <i>Chen</i>) are
Chinese. The names of captured Chinese ships have always been retained
by the Japanese, but they have been translated into their own language,
<i>i.e.</i> as though, when in the past we took the <i>Téméraire</i>,
we had taken to calling her <i>The Rash</i>.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my friends Commander Takarabé and Lieutenant Yamamoto,
both of the Imperial Japanese Navy, for the meanings of these ship-names.</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub2">Adsuma = a mountain with a poetical history.</li>
<li class="isub2">Asama = a sacred volcanic island in Japan. The present is the second</li>
<li class="isub6">ship of the name. The first was a pirate frigate that put into</li>
<li class="isub6">a Japanese port to refit and was seized.</li>
<li class="isub2">Akagi = a mountain in Japan.</li>
<li class="isub2">Akashi = a beautiful seaside place near Kobé. Akebono = dawn.</li>
<li class="isub2">Akitsushima = an old name for Japan (poetical).</li>
<li class="isub2">Asahi = “the (rising) morning sun.”</li>
<li class="isub2">Amagi = name of a mountain in Japan.
                         <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span></li>
<li class="isub2">Atago = name of a mountain in Japan.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chitose = “long life.”</li>
<li class="isub2">Chiyoda = the name of Shogun's castle and Emperor's palace. The</li>
<li class="isub6">&nbsp; present Chiyoda is the second of the name.
                    (<a href="#Page_402">See p. 402</a>.)</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Yen = “striking from a long way off.” The name is Chinese.</li>
<li class="isub7">This ship was formerly the Chinese Chen Yuen.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Nan = striking south.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin To = striking east.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Sei = striking west.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Hoku = striking north.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Chaiu = striking midway.</li>
<li class="isub2">Chin Pen = striking everywhere near.</li>
<li class="isub2">Fuso = “Japan.”</li>
<li class="isub2">Fuji = name of the celebrated Japanese mountain, Fuji-Yama.</li>
<li class="isub5">This is the second ship of the name.</li>
<li class="isub2">Hashidate = name of a Japanese port.</li>

<h2 class="nobreak">A JAPANESE NAVAL “AT HOME”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="fs_80">“</span><span class="smcap"><b>Captain Kawashibara</b></span>
and officers of H.I.J.M.S. Kasagi at home, Monday, March 15th.”</p>

<p>The Kasagi herself is an American-built ship.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this ship lies in the tremendous amount of
electricity there is on board her. The ammunition hoists are electric,
the lights and bells, of course, are, the engine-room indicators
are, and, finally, electric fans are all over the ship. So, too, are
telephones.</p>

<p>On the afternoon in question the fair ones of Portsmouth were initiated
into all these mysteries, and probably regarded the electric fans as
some new and horrible war device. I heard a remark to that effect,
anyhow!</p>

<p>Not all the visitors, however, were so inclined to regard everything as
a war machine. On Sunday a good many visitors of both sexes found their
way to the Kasagi, and peeped into the wardroom, where the officers
were wrestling with naval Kriegspiel.</p>

<p>“Race game,” said one lady; “how babyish these foreigners are!”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span></p>

<p>“I don't know, my dear,” replied her companion, apologetically.
“Perhaps they gamble on it for high stakes.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” was the response, “of course that makes a difference!”</p>

<p>For the “At Home” the Kasagi was <i>en fête</i>, draped in flags, and
generally looking her smartest. Even the engine-room was on show,
though I only noticed one visitor venture there—a lady in a light
fawn-coloured rig-out, not the best thing to penetrate the mysteries of
an engine-room in. Perhaps, however, she contented herself with peeping in.</p>

<p>The main feature of the “At Home” was an entertainment given by the
bluejackets. There was quite a long variety programme, with fencing
between each “turn.” As these encounters are accompanied by wild
yells every now and again on the part of the combatants, they are
particularly interesting.</p>

<p>There was a conjuring entertainment, which mightily amused the crew,
but perhaps puzzled the visitors somewhat as to what it was all about.
The best thing of all was a song by a Japanese sailor—a monotonous
chant that grew gradually louder, accompanied by various movements with
a sword, suggesting that something exciting was about to happen. Then
came in English, “That's all; you know!” It was well done, and its flat
finale very amusing.</p>

<p>There were dances of various sorts, sack races, egg races, and a few
other sports with which we are familiar, interesting here because the
performers were Japanese, and also because of their intense zest and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
evident pleasure. Some English songs by Japanese sailors were one of
the interesting bits, too.</p>

<p>Finally, on leaving, each lady guest was presented with a paper
chrysanthemum. They had previously been asking the Japanese officers
how they managed to get them to bloom in the summer season! The
imitations and colouring were perfect. The material for construction:
odd bits of paper and—Japanese bluejackets.</p>

It was currently reported, and for a long time believed in Japan, that
the Unebi had been captured by the Chinese and taken into one of their
harbours. Another report was to the effect that the Chinese had waylaid
and destroyed her—a not impossible incident. A typhoon is, however,
a more likely cause. It may be remembered that our gunboat Wasp
mysteriously disappeared in Far Eastern waters, and nothing was ever
heard as to how she perished.</p>

The drift of ultra-civilisation is towards peace and the arts. The
man of action must embody something of the savage, and the seeker
after universal peace draws his chief recruits from the ranks of
those who supply those luxuries of life that civilisation makes into
necessaries.</p>

The following I can vouch for, as I heard it myself:—A
certain warrant man in one of our destroyers came off leave one morning
a little late, and thus explained himself to his skipper: “I was
waiting for the train all right, sir, when some silly fool walking
across the line got run over by a train coming the other way. It took
both his legs off, and there was he and the legs lying on the line.
<i>I stood there laughing so that I clean forgot my train.</i>” This is
not exactly typical, but we have a good many such Mark Tapleys in the R.N.</p>

These Samaurai, or officer class—there were three classes in Japan:
(1) the nobles, descendants of rulers of provinces; (2) the officer
class; (3) the common people—for generation after generation lived very
uncertain lives; they were liable to be killed at any moment once they
left their homes. In addition, they were used to killing, having the
right to do so at pleasure. If they unsheathed their swords, they could
not replace them until they had killed some one. Possessing this power,
it is little wonder that a strong sense of dignity was acquired with it.</p>
